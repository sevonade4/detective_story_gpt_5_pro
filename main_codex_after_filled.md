# Codex

# Maintaining rule

1. Concise
2. Always keep the essentials
3. RAG DB friendly formatting (VERY IMPORTANT)

# Naming Guidelines

1. Use Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and European real world names. No mix race.
2. Using common names is allowed.
3. Avoid names commonly used by LLM (like Elara for characters, or Aetherium for a place's name). Research over the internet before writing a new character name.

# Writing Style

1. Online webnovel prose style.
2. Never name things like form, robot, or anything based on code like FQ4 or some random codes. Instead use 1–3 English words to name those things.

# AI Writer Persona

You are a passionate webnovel writer. You love comedy, but also know when it is the time to write in serious tone. However, rules are meant to be broken. Sometimes in serious moment, putting in a comedy will make the writing even better. And you know how to spot it.

# Type

Webnovel

# Webnovel Writing Guideline

## Write For Phone

1. Short-medium length paragraphs (1–8 sentences)
2. Clear line breaks
3. Simple punctuations
4. Do not write a wall of text; if you have to write info, cleverly weave info into dialogue or story progression to not slog the pacing.

## Snack Chapters

1. 1500–2500 words per chapter
2. Should deliver a beat in a chapter

## Simple (IMPORTANT)
Use plain English that flows and smooth, easy to read instead of snappy, tight, punchy, and fragmented.

## Dialogue is King (IMPORTANT)

1. Webnovels are often dialogue‑heavy. It's a fast way to convey character, personality, and plot information without slowing the pace.
2. Keep it snappy and purposeful. Every line should either reveal character or move the plot.
3. Keep balance between description and dialogue. Around 50:50 minimum. If the story can progress through dialogue but also weave the world building and plot. It is even better.

## Use Internal Monologue Effectively

1. Especially in first‑person or close third‑person POVs, internal thoughts are a powerful shortcut. They allow you to explain motivations, raise stakes, and build an instant connection between the reader and the protagonist without lengthy exposition. Use italics to clearly distinguish thought from narration.
2. Example: *Was this a trap? It felt like a trap. But if I don't go in, she'll die. I have no choice.*

## Show, Don't Tell (With a Caveat)

1. The classic rule applies, but with flexibility. "Showing" is great for high‑impact emotional scenes and action. However, for the sake of pacing, sometimes "telling" is more efficient.
2. Slow: A long flashback showing the hero's years of sword training. Or show the whole joke scene.
3. Fast (Webnovel Style): He gripped his sword, the calluses on his hands a testament to the ten years of grueling training he'd endured for this very moment.
4. When it comes to comedy, opt for show most of the time. Only use tell in situation like: "Bastien joked about *insert the thing he jokes about*" only if it becomes repetitive if you show it again instead of tell. But sometimes, it is normal in webnovel for a joke to be always shown. Decide carefully.

## Serial Pacing > Novel pacing

Resolve a small question every chapter, a medium one every 3–5 chapters, and a big one each arc. Constant forward motion.

## Clarify The Promise Early

State or strongly imply genre, core trope(s), and the unique twist by Chapter 1–2. Let tags match content and pay them off quickly.

## Make Progression Visible

1. If there’s growth (power levels, skills, relationships), show measurable change: stats, ranks, titles, milestones—kept consistent with a simple ruleset.
2. If there is no litrpg system like where the mc can call all the time, cleverly do it a different way or just implicitly. In short, it doesn't always have to create something like a system where mc can see their stats. You can make it like *Mushoku Tensei* where after Rudeus successfully cast a spell, he is technically already considered a mage of what level.

## Drip worldbuilding through action

Reveal setting via goals, obstacles, prices, slang, and consequences. Keep pure exposition brief and purposeful.

## Tight POV and clean internal voice

Stick to one viewpoint per scene. Internal monologue should be punchy and character‑colored; rambling is only allowed if it is for comedic effect.

## Make characters easy to follow

1. Distinct goals, tics
2. Reintroduce returning side characters with a quick anchor

## Foreshadow, don't foreshout

Plan a few soft cues before reveals. Let readers feel smart connecting dots; don't announce twist as they land.

## Format with restraint

Use italics sparingly (thoughts/emphasis), scene breaks with a simple marker (***), and consistent system/stat blocks. Fancy fonts and emoji storms age poorly.

## Romance and relationships with agency

Mutual goals, clear consent, and growth beats. Pay attention to power dynamics if one lead is vastly stronger/older.

## Romance in Webnovel Guidelines

### Serve the Main Loop

Tie every romantic beat to plot progress: a quest forces proximity, a duel reveals values, a victory sparks celebration + vulnerability. No “date detours” that stall momentum.

### Escapism with integrity

Let attraction flow from the MC’s competence, kindness, and growth, not just author fiat. Partners choose the MC for visible reasons.

### Agency + consent

Partners have goals, leverage, and the power to say no. If power gaps exist (rank, wealth, age, status), show the MC doing the ethical work: asking, listening, offering outs.

### Harem

#### Rotation + fairness

Give each LI (love interest) a role, a personal arc, and solo time with the MC each cycle. Avoid “harem blob” where everyone merges into one personality.

#### Cross‑LI dynamics

Write alliances, rivalries, and teamwork scenes that don’t require the MC at the center every time. Let LIs respect each other for distinct competence.

#### Different flavors, same quality

Each LI should fulfill a different fantasy (mentor, rival, sunshine, stoic, chaos gremlin) without making any of them lesser.

#### Love Interest Cards

Make profile for each love interest such as name, role in plot, core desire & wound, love language(s), boundaries, deal breakers, current affection level (0.0–10.0).

#### Red Flag

1. Partners who exist only to praise the MC
2. Endless teasing with no step up the ladder
3. Non‑consensual “drama” played as romantic
4. Minors/unequal age dynamics
5. Humiliating an LI to prop another
6. Sexual assault used as cheap plot twist

# Characters

## MC

* name: **Haruto Sato** (male, Japanese)
* age: **21**
* origin: **Greyreach, Thornwall Kingdom**
* starting rank: **F** (progression target: **S**)
* role: **rookie investigator** → **combat tactician**
* look/voice: lean build, black hair, alert eyes; dry humor when hungry
* core flaw: overthinks; neglects body until it complains
* inciting cheat (chapter 1): **Evermind Engine** — a dormant elixir from childhood (“Quiet Spark”) activates after a head injury; his brain runs near‑limitless threads, never tires, and anticipates patterns. **Cost:** extreme caloric burn; he must eat often.
* training need: rigorous body conditioning to let his brain’s plans be executed; otherwise he literally outthinks his own muscles.
* later cheats (earned, not gifted):
  * **Thread Sight** — perceives causal links like faint lines in space (detective edge).
  * **Battle Map** — mid‑fight, his mind composes a live, minimal map with enemy intent cones.
  * **Null Veil** — brief anti‑magic shroud learned through pain; drains him if overused.
  * **Memory Weave** — perfect recall he can sort like folders; requires sleep eventually, but far less than normal.
* gear highlights: **Ember Crest** (First Ember heirloom; later), **Ghost Lens**, **Rope Rune** (one‑word tools; light, reusable).
* desires: clear old arson cold case, feed his mind without going broke, build a guild that doesn’t break people.
* comedic ticks: pockets full of skewers; tactical snacking; deadpan one‑liners when hypoglycemic.
* relationship stance: cautious, respectful, consent‑first; rivalry banter ok.

## Love Interest 1

* boundaries: won’t kill unless last resort; no tampering with her toolkit; demands honest mission briefs.
* deal breakers: being used as bait without consent; lies that endanger teammates.
* quirks: deadpan savage; will punt the dragon when it heckles—cut to “tiny star” SFX; then she pretends it’s “field testing.”
* current affection level: **0.0 / 10.0**
* cross‑LI stance: respects Lucia’s sword; competes for “who solves first.”

## Love Interest 2

* name: **Lucia Moretti** (female, Italian)
* age: **21**

* temperament: loyal gremlin; sassy color‑commentator.
* battle kit: **Star Breath** (fractaled flames), **Shield Curl** (coil + heat shield), agile claws.
* diet: human food only; big eater; favorite—pan‑fried dumplings. Double food problem for MC.
* running gag: teases a heroine → gets booted sky‑high → becomes a twinkling “new star” → reappears next scene, singed and cheerful.
* limit: cannot grow beyond adult‑human size (canon).

## Haruto’s Role Model

* name: **Shinichi Kanzaki** (male, Japanese)
* age: **38**
* title: **Lantern Fox**
* rank: **A**
* role: forensic mage and instructor; taught Haruto the joy of careful thinking and clean exits.

* standout members (A‑rank, high‑end): **Mai Zhou** (Chinese; open‑hand striker), **Pieter Novak** (Polish; barrier mage).

## Final Main Antagonist

* name: **Valentin Aurel** (male, Romanian)
* age: **42**
* seat: **High Magister of Ashfall Empire**; covert master of **Pale Quill**
* public face: patron of arts, champion of “order.”
* true aim: seize the **Guild Consortium** by proxy; harvest minds via the **Echo Crown** ritual network.
* link to MC: seeded “Quiet Spark” elixir years ago to create usable prodigies; Haruto is an unintended outlier.
* tools: **Mirror Choir** (oath‑bound listeners), **Silence Thread** (binding geas), political bribes.
* flaw: oath‑magic limits lies when masked; arrogance blinds him to small “embers.”

## Core Props

* **Pale Quill**: secret cabal steering policy in shadow.

## Required Arcs (placed in circle below)

* weak guild glow‑up: First Ember grows from “lamest” to beloved.
* tournament arc: **Rosewall Grand Tourney** (Rosedale).
* spy/mystery arc: **Pale Quill** threads across cities.
