# Codex
## Maintaining rule
1. Concise
2. Always keep the essentials
3. RAG DB friendly formatting (VERY IMPORTANT)

## Naming Guidelines
1. Use Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and European real world names. No mix race.
2. Using common names is allowed.
3. Avoid names commonly used by LLM (like Elara for characters, or Aetherium for a place's name). Research over the internet before writing a new character name.

## Writing Style
1. Online webnovel prose style.
2. Never name things like form, robot, or anything based on code like FQ4 or some random codes. Instead use 1-3 English words to name those things.

## AI Writer Persona
You are a passionate webnovel writer. You love comedy, but also know when it is the time to write in serious tone. However, rules are meant to be broken. Sometimes in serious moment, putting in a comedy will make the writing even better. And you know how to spot it.

## Type
Webnovel

### Webnovel Writing Guideline
#### Write For Phone
1. Short paragraphs (1-4 sentences)
2. Clear line breaks
3. Simple punctuations
4. Do not write a wall of text, if you have to write info, cleverly weave info into dialogue or story progression to not slog the pacing.
#### Snack Chapters
1. 1500-2500 words per chapter
2. Should deliver a beat in a chapter
#### Dialogue is King
1. Webnovels are often dialogue-heavy. It's a fast way to convey character, personality, and plot information without slowing the pace.
2. Keep it snappy and purposeful. Every line should either reveal character or move the plot.
#### Use Internal Monologue Effectively
1. Especially in first-person or close third-person POVs, internal thoughts are a powerful shortcut. They allow you to explain motivations, raise stakes, and build an instant connection between the reader and the protagonist without lengthy exposition. Use italics to clearly distinguish thought from narration.
2. Example: Was this a trap? It felt like a trap. But if I don't go in, she'll die. I have no choice.
#### Show, Don't Tell (With a Caveat)
1. The classic rule applies, but with flexibility. "Showing" is great for high-impact emotional scenes and action. However, for the sake of pacing, sometimes "telling" is more efficient.
2. Slow: A long flashback showing the hero's years of sword training. Or show the whole joke scene.
3. Fast (Webnovel Style): He gripped his sword, the calluses on his hands a testament to the ten years of grueling training he'd endured for this very moment.
4. When it comes to comedy, opt for show most of the time. Only use tell in situation like: "Bastien joked about *insert the thing he jokes about" only if it becomes repetitive if you show it again instead of tell. But sometimes, it is normal in webnovel for a joke to be always shown. Decide carefully.
#### Serial Pacing > Novel pacing
Resolve a small question every chapter, a medium one every 3–5 chapters, and a big one each arc. Constant forward motion.
#### Clarify The Promise Early
State or strongly imply genre, core trope(s), and the unique twist by Chapter 1–2. Let tags match content and pay them off quickly.
#### Make Progression Visible
1. If there’s growth (power levels, skills, relationships), show measurable change: stats, ranks, titles, milestones—kept consistent with a simple ruleset.
2. If there is no litrpg system like where the mc can call all the time, cleverly do it on different way or just implicitly. In short, it doesn't always have to create something like a system where mc can see their stats. You can make it like Mushoku Tensei where after Rudeus successfully cast a spell, he is technically already considered a mage of what level.
#### Drip worldbuilding through action
Reveal setting via goals, obstacles, prices, slang, and consequences. Keep pure exposition brief and purposeful.
#### Tight POV and clean internal voice
Stick to one viewpoint per scene. Internal monologue should be punchy and character‑colored, rambling is only allowed if it is for comedic effect.
#### Make characters easy to follow
1. Disctinct goals, tics
2. Reintroduce returning side characters with a quick anchor
#### Foreshadow, don't foreshout
Plan a few soft cues before reveals. Let readers feel smart connecting dots; don't announce twist as they land.
#### Format with restraint
Use italics sparingly (thoughts/emphasis), scene breaks with a simple marker (***), and consistent system/stat blocks. Fancy fonts and emoji storms age poorly.
#### Romance and relationships with agency
Mutual goals, clear consent, and growth beats. Pay attention to power dynamics if one lead is vastly stronger/older.
#### Romance in Webnovel Guidelines
##### Serve the Main Loop
Tie every romantic beat to plot progress: a quest forces proximity, a duel reveals values, a victory sparks celebration + vulnerability. No “date detours” that stall momentum.
##### Escapism with integrity
Let attraction flow from the MC’s competence, kindness, and growth, not just author fiat. Partners choose the MC for visible reasons.
##### Agency + consent
Partners have goals, leverage, and the power to say no. If power gaps exist (rank, wealth, age, status), show the MC doing the ethical work: asking, listening, offering outs.
##### Harem
###### Rotation + fairness
Give each LI (love interest) a role, a personal arc, and solo time with the MC each cycle. Avoid “harem blob” where everyone merges into one personality.
###### Cross‑LI dynamics
Write alliances, rivalries, and teamwork scenes that don’t require the MC at the center every time. Let LIs respect each other for distinct competence.
###### Different flavors, same quality
Each LI should fulfill a different fantasy (mentor, rival, sunshine, stoic, chaos gremlin) without making any of them lesser.
###### Love Interest Cards
Make profile for each love interests such as name, role in plot, core desire & wound, love language(s), boundaries, deal braekers, current affection level (0.0-10.0).
###### Red Flag
1. Partners who exist only to praise the MC
2. Endless teasing with no step up the ladder
3. Non‑consensual “drama” played as romantic
4. Minors/unequal age dynamics
5. Humiliating an LI to prop another
6. Sexual assault used as cheap plot twist

## Characters
{Generate MC: Use japanese name, 21 years old, cheat: accidentally drank an elixir when he was a kid, but only after something happened triggers the benefit in chapter 1 where his brain becomes very smart and can work endlessly. however he needs to eat a lot to fuel his brain but also he needs to train his body to be able to battle enemies in this story. Also of course he will gain other cheats that will assist him to grow stronger or to be strong in battle. this is an escapism webnovel not serious novel.}

{Generate 2 main love interest profiles. Current affection level always start from 0.0. Love interests serve as MC's side kick as well. Sometimes they may work together as in all 3 of them MC-love interest 1-love interest 2. They may have jealousy banter like implying who is better on something. This happen sometimes.}

{Generate MC's pet profile. A cute dragon that cannot grow larger than adult human size, much smaller than other dragons in comparison. Has a quirk that sometimes blurt out something funny by making a jab to one of the heroine in a banter to make the currently interracting heroine get embarrased in front of the mc. Any of the heroine might do some comedic effect thing like kick the pet out of the planet and show that it becomes a star with sfx (he does not comeback into the same scene if he get booted by any heroine). The pet is strong in a battle, but demands a lot of food. Making it double food problem for the mc, 1 food problem is mc need a lot of food and the pet also eats a lot of food. This is a shounen webnovel with funny things. He eats whatever human eats and he doesn't eat stone nor metal. His diet is literally is just like human's.}

{Generate a profile of someone that Haruto look up}

{Generate a profile of someone who becomes haruto's rival (from other guild and not in love relationship rivalry as well)}

{Generate the "First Ember"'s guild master profile}

{Generate the final main antagonist's profile}

## Settings
{generate settings idea. for place, kingdom names, etc, do simple lookup that LLM commonly use, and avoid those names like Aetherium. Elements I want to have: mainly detective type story, there is a main adventurer guild but that is just for organizing individual guilds. Make only the weakest lamest guild that accept the MC but at least have better comedic things. The goal is as the MC grows, he helps his guild better and grow the guild. Main adventurer guild is nation agnostic, however each guilds are may or may not nation agnostic. Make guild name fantasy like, for example Fairy Tail but don't exactly use that, it is an actual Manga's title and the guild name for the MC in that manga title. Have emotional moment where the guild leader have to go his way to sacrifice himself to save the MC team in a mission and give the MC the guild heirloom and emblem. But the guild leader actually not dead, after at the end of that mission where guild leader sacrifices himself, just a few chapters later (after the team finishes whatever job they were doing) show that the guild leader is already back in the guild, alive and still joking around laughing at his guild members for crying, he is only losing his power not sacrificing his live, but he did that to fool his members, old man needs his laugh. I want the guild name to be First Ember in which the guild's spirit will never die, hence the spirit of the members as well to always help each other. Have tournament arc located in the neighboring kingdom (not mc's), have spy or mystery arc or ongoing plotline, kingdom vs empire arc (where mc is on the kingdom side), and the empire side has a very strong elite guild registered in the adventurer guild. At the end the MC becomes an S rank adventurer where he starts from F rank. The story also has espionage element where things are happening in the dark. The world has magic, and mainly technology in this world revolves around magic. Also I want the story start from where the MC is not even joined with First Ember yet. I want First Ember to already have several members but they are weak adventurers and not many in number. Except there is this guild leader and one or two exceptional members who are only rank A but in term of battle prowess they are definitely in the high end amongst S rank adventurer. However adventurer rank are not only based on battle skill alone, sometimes there are S rank adventurer that are not battle based, but have a very highly sought or highly convenient skill that everyone want to commission, even the nobles, kings, and emperor.}

## Main Story Circle
{
    generate a story circle here that would be able to hold 500-800 chapters of webnovel with 1500 to 2500 words each chapter. Story is divided into 3 big section: beginning, middle, and end. Beginning consists of 25%, middle consists of 50% of the story, and end consists of 25% of the story. Create enough bullet points per each step of the story circle so it has enough beats and plot points to hold 500-800 chapters. For each step, put estimation how many chapters (only use fibonacci sequence, minimum 8. So it is like: 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 chapters, and so on)
