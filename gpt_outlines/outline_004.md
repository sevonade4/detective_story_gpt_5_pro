Below is a **beat‑by‑beat outline** for **Chapter 4** that comfortably supports **\~1,800–2,200 words** (within your 1,500–2,500 target). It keeps a tight Haruto‑POV, uses dialogue‑forward scene plans, and resolves a small question this chapter (“Does the egg respond to food?”) while seeding the petty‑theft case and Dock Lions pressure for Chapters 5–8.

---

## Chapter 4 — **Steam & Dumplings**

**POV:** Close third on **Haruto Sato**
**Core question to resolve (small):** *Is keeping the egg secret—for now—actually workable, and does it really calm to food/heat?*
**Secondary goals:** duplicate evidence for the watch; avoid Dock Lions bite; set up Kenta’s “petty theft” hook and Naomi’s extortion stakes.
**Promise:** detective + light comedy, with Evermind method, snack‑fuel gags, and one clean lead into Chapter 5.

---

### Scene 1 — **Kitchen Science, Rookie Edition** (Home; morning‑to‑late‑morning)

**Target length:** 300–400 words

* **Objective:** Haruto tests whether *food* calms the egg as well as *steam*; formalize “deferred truth” as a rule, not an excuse.
* **Blocking:**

  * He sets the egg on a folded shirt, angles the kettle, and opens Naomi’s leftover dumpling packet beside it.
  * The **Evermind committee** splits into threads: *heat only? aroma too? direct contact?* He lays out a mini‑experiment with cheap rigor.
  * He times hum changes against three stimuli: kettle steam; steam + open dumplings; dumpling held over shell (never touching).
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Haruto (soft, to egg): “If food calms me, we can be consistent about it. House rules.”
  * *Internal, italicized:* *Don’t anthropomorphize evidence. Also… hello, little problem.*
* **Comedy beats:** the egg’s hum *purrs* louder when the dumpling scent hits; Haruto, deadpan: “Peer‑reviewed by my stomach.” He nearly bites a “control sample,” then eats it because science.
* **Worldbuilding drip:** cheap room; kettle hisses; faint *echo wire* clicks outside; joiner’s snore across the alley.
* **Outcome:** **Confirmed**—aroma + warmth increase the egg’s steady hum. He drafts a **“Steam Cycle”** schedule in his notebook.
* **Notebook inserts (quick):**

  * *Steam 90 sec → hum ↑; aroma present → hum ↑↑.*
  * *Deferred truth: log private; file later w/ proof.*
  * *Egg care: warmth/steam; avoid shock/cold; no jostle.*

---

### Scene 2 — **Deferred Truth, Stated Out Loud** (Home → stairwell; late morning)

**Target length:** 150–200 words

* **Objective:** Put the **“Deferred Truth”** rule on the page and in his mouth; commit to later disclosure.
* **Blocking:** He wraps the egg (loose) under his coat, sets the kettle on low with a damp cloth nearby to hold heat, and rehearses what he will and won’t say if stopped.
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Haruto (murmured): “I log it now. I file it when safe. Not a lie—**deferred**.”
  * *Internal:* *If I report today, it gets seized. If I secure proof, it becomes a life, not a label.*
* **Outcome:** He exits with the egg hidden, routes chosen **before** stepping outside.

---

### Scene 3 — **Rope Lane Check & Rubbing #2** (Rope Lane; late morning)

**Target length:** 250–350 words

* **Objective:** Duplicate the **graphite rubbing** cleanly; grab one more sample; get out unseen.
* **Blocking:**

  * He marks exits: canal stairs, cart gap by Naomi, rope ladder. **“Exit before enter.”**
  * Quick re‑rubbing of the **45° cut** on the fire counter‑ward corner; labels angle; photographs in words (measurements, hand‑spans).
  * New observation: **shoe scuff** pattern near plaque void—two distinct treads; one drags slightly (injury? heavy load?).
* **Dock Lions pressure:** A Lion leans at lane mouth, **cheap iron badge** seam catching light.
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Lion: “You again. Counting bricks for the city?”
  * Haruto (not looking up): “Counting angles. More reliable than moods.”
  * Lion: “You got a name?”
  * Haruto: “Dumpling‑adjacent.”
* **Tactic:** **Mark, don’t bark.** He does not escalate; keeps pencil moving; shows he’s filing *lines*, not *names*.
* **Outcome:** Clean duplicate rubbing secured; pocketed wick flake; tension **set but unfired**.

---

### Scene 4 — **Naomi’s Gong & the “Safety Tax”** (Twilight market edge; midday)

**Target length:** 250–350 words

* **Objective:** Refuel; slide social intel from Naomi; show extortion pressure that will pay off in Ch. 6–8.
* **Blocking:**

  * Naomi clocks the bandage and the **eyes steadier after food**; she thrusts a skewer. *GONG* pan‑bang gag lands.
  * Two **Dock Lions** swagger past, tapping Naomi’s tip jar in a “joke” that isn’t.
  * Haruto physically positions so the Lions have to walk around him without inviting a fight.
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Naomi: “Eat first. If you faint, I charge double for drama.”
  * Lion #1 (faux‑friendly): “Stall fee’s up. Fire season.”
  * Haruto (mild): “Is the season registered with the watch, or just your mold?” (eyes on the **badge seam**)
  * Naomi (to Haruto, low): “Pick a battle you can finish.”
  * Haruto: “Copy.” Then louder, to Lions: “You’re blocking the bucket line marker.” (Points at chalk mark; he makes moving aside look like civic duty.)
* **Outcome:** The Lions move on with a **we‑see‑you** look; Naomi grumbles but approves the **non‑confrontation**. She slips him a **paper packet** “for later,” code for *eat again soon*.

---

### Scene 5 — **Skewer Scouts: Recruitment Drive (1)** (Alley behind market; early afternoon)

**Target length:** 200–300 words

* **Objective:** Reintroduce **Kenta Mori** as the first **Skewer Scout**; set the **petty theft / ledger in kitchen code** hook for Chapter 5.
* **Blocking:**

  * Kenta appears like a cat from a barrel shadow, eyes on the packet.
  * Haruto swaps a skewer for **news**: asks who’s buying **scrap plaques** today; any whispers about **feather coins**; any courier routes avoiding bell posts.
  * Kenta offers a **lead**: small theft ring trading **“recipes”** that aren’t recipes—delivery times embedded in spice lines.
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Kenta: “Two bites for a rumor.”
  * Haruto: “One bite, and you get promoted to ‘don’t get arrested.’”
  * Kenta (grinning): “Deal. Grey‑Cap’s awake. Buys metal square things when sober.”
  * Haruto: “Rope Lane ink shop corner. Noted.”
* **Outcome:** Haruto sets a **meet** with Kenta at dusk for the “recipe ledger”; this will **launch Chapter 5**.

---

### Scene 6 — **Watch Post, Paper Before Names** (Bell post; mid‑afternoon)

**Target length:** 200–300 words

* **Objective:** Deliver the **duplicate rubbing** and **new measurements**; maintain trust with **chipped‑tooth watchman** without revealing the egg.
* **Blocking:**

  * Haruto lays the rubbing, lists the **9×12 hand‑spans** plaque void, notes **sheared screws**, **wick flakes**, and the **carrier ring** he observed earlier.
  * He mentions the **scuff pattern** (two treads; one drag), which is **useful** and **safe**.
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Watchman: “You got a photo yet?”
  * Haruto: “Working the scrap angle. Might find the plaque before the thief finds a file.”
  * Watchman (quiet): “Lions are sniffing for whoever thinks in lanes. Keep your head where the vendor can hit it with a spoon.”
  * Haruto: “Already contracted for spoon deterrence.”
* **Outcome:** The watchman files the rubbing (“*That we can file*”), gives a **nod** that is almost gratitude, and reiterates **caution**.

---

### Scene 7 — **Grey‑Cap’s Sobriety Window** (Rope Lane, ink‑shop adjacent; late afternoon)

**Target length:** 250–350 words

* **Objective:** Soft introduction to **Grey‑Cap Fence**; sniff for the missing plaque without lighting a war.
* **Blocking:**

  * Grey‑Cap is lucid‑tipsy; sells bent spoons and “art.” A **metal rectangle** edge peeks under burlap—wrong size, but **sheared screws** embedded in a different plate suggest a **pattern** (someone is yanking fixtures all over).
  * Haruto **doesn’t buy** (no coin); he takes a **graphite impression** of the screw spacing on a *different* plate to compare later (cheap forensic trick).
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Haruto: “Looking for wall jewelry. Missing its screws.”
  * Grey‑Cap (squinting): “You a priest of bolts?”
  * Haruto: “A lay brother of measurements.”
* **Outcome:** No plaque yet, but he confirms **multiple plaques** are being stripped citywide—**escalation seed**. He leaves **marked but not memorable**.

---

### Scene 8 — **Back to Base: Egg Care Protocol** (Home; early evening)

**Target length:** 200–300 words

* **Objective:** Close the chapter’s main question; codify egg care; tie Evermind to body care (food rule).
* **Blocking:**

  * He checks the egg’s temperature by palm; sets the kettle; opens the **paper packet** of dumplings—**hum intensifies** in a now‑familiar way.
  * He drafts a **simple “care protocol”** on one page, **Evermind‑style** but human readable.
* **Notebook inserts (clear, brief lines):**

  * *Steam cycle:* 60–90 sec every 2–3 hours while home.
  * *Aroma cue:* food nearby calms (esp. dumplings).
  * *Don’t jostle; keep warm wrap; no direct burn.*
  * *Deferred truth timer:* report after stabilizing heat source + identify owner/ritual link (if any).
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Haruto (to egg): “You hum, I feed. We keep each other from doing anything stupid.”
  * *Internal:* *I am not ready to write ‘dragon.’ I am ready to write ‘responsibility.’*
* **Outcome (resolution of small question):** **Yes**—food scent clearly calms the egg. Keeping it secret is **workable today** with a plan.

---

### Scene 9 — **Hook to Chapter 5: The “Cookbook” Ledger** (Door knock; night)

**Target length:** 150–200 words

* **Objective:** Clean handoff to next chapter’s case.
* **Blocking:**

  * Light knock pattern at Haruto’s door: **tap‑tap…tap** (the alley kids’ “friendly” code).
  * **Kenta** slips in with a grease‑spotted **notebook** (“recipes”), whispers that a **canal runner** dropped it and two big boys are looking for it.
  * Haruto flips to a page: **clove, cumin, bay** listed like a spice poem—**Evermind** threads spin: *not ingredients—time codes*.
* **Dialogue seeds:**

  * Kenta: “If this is soup, it’s hot. If it’s not… it’s still hot.”
  * Haruto (already mapping): “We’ll cook it in the morning.”
* **Outcome:** Stakes for **Ch. 5** (“petty theft” → **courier ledger in kitchen code**) established.

## Pacing & Word Count Plan (Phone‑friendly)

* S1: 350
* S2: 180
* S3: 320
* S4: 300
* S5: 260
* S6: 260
* S7: 300
* S8: 240
* S9: 180
  **Total:** \~2,390 words (adjust ±15% during drafting by trimming S3/S7 or expanding S4/S8 dialogue)

---

## Dialogue & Internal Monologue Emphasis

* **Dialogue ≥50%**: every scene has back‑and‑forth (Haruto ↔ Naomi, Haruto ↔ Lions, Haruto ↔ Kenta, Haruto ↔ Watchman, Haruto ↔ Grey‑Cap, Haruto ↔ egg monologue).
* **Internal thoughts** flagged in *italics* at decision points: *report vs defer*, *fight vs file*, *food vs faint*.

---

## Running Gags / Character Tics (light, not overused)

* **Food rule**: “Focus rides on food.” Naomi enforces; Haruto obeys—eventually.
* **Pan‑bang gong**: Naomi’s signature SFX covers the egg’s tiny hum once (a near‑miss).
* **Badge seam**: Haruto keeps noticing the Dock Lions’ **cheap pour line**—a visual tell.

---

## Evidence & Clues Logged (Detective Core)

* **Confirmed sabotage**: **45° cut** on the ward’s key stroke (trained hand).
* **Plaque void**: **9×12 hand‑spans**, **sheared screws**.
* **Scuff pattern**: two treads; one drag—possible injured runner or heavy carry.
* **Carrier ring**: supports multiple **fuse jars** (from Ch. 3)—reiterated context.
* **Citywide plaque stripping** hint via **Grey‑Cap**—escalation seed for later.
* **Cookbook ledger**: spice lists as **time/place codes**—launchpad for Ch. 5.

---

## Stakes & Safety

* **Haruto’s body**: still paying the calorie tax of the **Evermind Engine**; snack cadence matters.
* **Civilians first**: zero public confrontation with Lions today; he files what the watch can actually use.
* **Egg secrecy**: codified as **“deferred truth”**, not permanent concealment.

---

## Foreshadowing (soft)

* “Copycat fire” talk on the street (two dockworkers gossip as Haruto passes) → seeds **Chapter 7**.
* Grey‑Cap’s “art plate” with **sheared screws** suggests a **pattern**—later links to the **Pale Quill** collection habit.
* Naomi’s rising **stall pressure** primes **Chapter 6** and **Chapter 8** outcomes.

---

## Exit Line Options (pick one tone)

1. **Calm resolve:**
   *He set the kettle to whisper and opened the paper packet. The egg’s hum smoothed out like a breath finding rhythm. “All right,” Haruto said. “We work the small truths first.”*

2. **Wry hook into Ch. 5:**
   *Kenta tapped the “clove—cumin—bay” page. “Hungry?” he asked. Haruto smiled. “Starving. Let’s eat a schedule.”*

---

### Quick Continuity Check Against Canon

* **No guild members yet** (First Ember appears later).
* **Egg** remains pre‑hatch; hums, seeks heat/steam, calms to warmth/food scent (canon‑consistent).
* **Watch contact** used; accepts rubbings; repeats practical filing line.
* **Dock Lions**: intimidation without escalation; badge seam tell used.
* **Kenta**: grows the Skewer Scouts link and hands Chapter 5 its case.
