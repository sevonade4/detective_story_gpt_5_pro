# Chapter 1 Outline — “Skewers & Shadows”

**POV:** Close third on **Haruto Sato**
**Setting:** Greyreach, Thornwall Kingdom — twilight market by the canal; drizzle, rune‑lamps flicker.
**Length target:** 1,800–2,200 words (phone‑friendly paragraphs)
**Chapter beat delivered:** Haruto solves a petty theft using observation and snacks; seeds the dock extortion + next‑chapter fire.

---

## What this chapter promises (early & clear)

* **Genre/Tropes:** Thriller–mystery with action and light comedy; “weak to strong” seed shown via Haruto’s F‑rank and low stamina but sharp instincts.
* **MC hook:** Dry humor, kind ethics, *tactical snacking*.
* **World drip:** Magic‑first tech in the background (rune‑lamps, echo wire posts, glyphrail whistle far off), guild culture mentioned but not explained in a block.
* **Foreshadow:** Dock thugs (“Dock Lions”), distant smoke at the docks → tomorrow’s arson chase.

---

## Stakes & Goals (on page)

* **Immediate goal:** Return a stolen purse without a brawl; prove he’s worth hiring.
* **Personal stakes:** Rent and food money; reputation as a rookie investigator (F‑rank, freelance).
* **Moral line:** Haruto prefers non‑lethal fixes and second chances; doesn’t hand kids to brutal guards unless forced.

---

## Cast on stage

* **Haruto Sato (21):** lean, alert eyes, calm voice; hungry.
* **Pickpocket kid — Kenta Mori (13–14):** wiry, stubborn, not cruel. (Seed for future **Skewer Scouts**.)
* **Market vendor cameo — Naomi Kuroda:** brisk, kind, “taxed” by Dock Lions. (Proper intro later, but she’s a face here.)
* **Dock Lions goon (unnamed):** soft threat, flashes a lion badge, sets longer fuse.

---

## Scene‑by‑scene

### Scene 1 — Hook: The bait on a stick (Market edge, twilight)

**Purpose:** Open with motion + competence + comedy.
**Action beats:**

* Haruto buys two meat skewers, lets one dangle at pocket level, drifts through the crowd.
* He clocks tells: a left‑foot drag, a jacket cut for quick slip, a glance at vendor belts.
* He positions by a puddle to watch reflections; angles his body so the “bait” is inviting.

**Dialogue snippets:**

* **Naomi:** “You again, investigator? You paying or casing my grill?”
* **Haruto:** “Both. One for fuel, one for friendship. The second is for whoever thinks I don’t see him.”

**Internal monologue cues:**

* *Smell hits, stomach answers. Focus now, eat later. No—eat now, focus better.*
* *Kanzaki said: choose the exit before you enter. Exit’s the alley by the rope warehouse.*

**World drip:** Rune‑lamps thrum faintly; an **echo wire** pole ticks out boat arrivals; a glyphrail whistle carries from the far viaduct.

**Comedy beat:** His stomach growls so loudly the pickpocket flinches and glances over—confirming the mark.

---

### Scene 2 — Soft catch, softer terms (Narrow alley behind stalls)

**Purpose:** Show Haruto’s method: talk first, time second, minimal chase.
**Action beats:**

* Kenta plucks the purse and bolts; Haruto doesn’t sprint—he cuts the angle (pre‑Evermind, just smart).
* He reaches the blind corner first, holding up the second skewer like a traffic wand.

**Dialogue snippets:**

* **Haruto:** “Trade you one skewer for everything in your left sleeve.”
* **Kenta:** “It’s chicken. I don’t trade for chicken.”
* **Haruto:** “Two bites and I forget your face.”
* **Kenta:** “You already know my face.”
* **Haruto (deadpan):** “I’m very forgetful when fed.”

**Resolution beats:**

* Kenta hands over the purse and a few loose coins; Haruto checks contents in view, ties the purse string properly.
* Haruto asks questions instead of threats: who buys lifted goods, who’s taxing vendors, what nights the “lions” prowl.

**Mini‑deal (Skewer Scouts seed):**

* Haruto offers hot food for alley news, no snitching name drops, warn him if violence is planned.
* Kenta tests him: “Dock Lions pull ‘collection’ at **Quay Nine** tonight.” (Seed.)

**Internal monologue cue:** *Kid watches exits first. Not cruel. Hungry. Easy to push, easier to hire.*

**Comedy beat:** Haruto lets Kenta take a bite mid‑negotiation. Kenta burns his tongue, blames the skewer. “It assaulted me.”

---

### Scene 3 — The return & the warning (Back at the stall)

**Purpose:** Pay off the small mystery; slide in the bigger problem.
**Action beats:**

* Purse returned to a seamstress customer; relief, a small reward pressed into Haruto’s hand.
* A Dock Lions goon steps in, tries to collect “night safety dues” from Naomi. Haruto doesn’t escalate; he measures.

**Dialogue snippets:**

* **Goon:** “Tax is up. New schedule.”
* **Haruto:** “Funny, I didn’t hear the city change its laws at dinner.”
* **Goon:** “It changed on my say.”
* **Naomi (tight smile):** “We’ll talk after closing.”

**Tension management:**

* Haruto notes the lion badge (rough iron, poor finish) and a scar pattern—he files details for later.
* He quietly tells Naomi he’ll be around Quay Nine. She slides him a paper boat of dumplings “on credit.”

**World drip:** Guard patrols avoid the alley at this hour; unofficial curfews exist where guilds are thin.

**Internal monologue cue:** *Not tonight. Pick battles you can finish. Track, don’t bark.*

---

### Scene 4 — Quiet room, loud city (Haruto’s tiny rented room; night)

**Purpose:** Humanize the MC; plant long‑term mystery; launch into Ch. 2.
**Action beats:**

* He counts coins, sets aside rent, stares at a thin folder: **Old Arson — Docks**. A simple feather sketch clipped in the corner (no exposition).
* He wolfs dumplings, writes three clean notes: **Quay Nine—collectors; Kenta—hungry but smart; Badge—iron pour line on mane**.

**Internal monologue cues:**

* *One purse saved buys maybe two meals. Ten purses don’t fix the docks.*
* *Tomorrow—watch the collection, follow, eat first.*

**Sound bridge into next chapter:**

* A bell starts hammering across the water. Someone shouts from the street: “Fire at Quay Nine!”
* Haruto grabs his coat and the half‑eaten skewer, runs.

**Closing line options (pick one in drafting):**

1. *Dinner later. Fire first.*
2. *Bad timing, good bait.*
3. *Quay Nine again. Of course it is.*

---

## Dialogue pack (ready‑to‑drop lines)

* “Trade you one skewer for everything in your left sleeve.”
* “I’m very forgetful when fed.”
* “Funny, I didn’t hear the city change its laws at dinner.”
* “Pick battles you can finish. The rest? You mark and you wait.”

---

## Internal monologue pack (use italics)

* *Focus rides on food; stop pretending otherwise.*
* *Choose the exit before you enter.*
* *Not a fighter tonight. A ledger with legs.*

---

## Worldbuilding drip (tiny & useful)

* Rune‑lamps hum; **echo wire** poles click out ship schedules.
* “Guild rates” mentioned by a vendor—people hire small teams for protection when guards ignore alleys.
* A far **glyphrail** whistle threads through the drizzle (tech exists, no infodump).

---

## Comedy valve plan (light, not undercutting stakes)

* Stomach growl as accidental signal.
* The “skewer negotiation” gag.
* Kenta’s “the skewer assaulted me” line; Naomi’s dry look.

---

## Foreshadow seeds (soft cues only)

* **Dock Lions** badge + “Quay Nine tonight” → extortion subplot.
* Feather sketch on the old file → long cold case.
* Distant **fire bell** → Chapter 2’s dockside arson chase (Evermind awakening next chapter).

---

## Progression anchors (implicit)

* **Rank:** Haruto flashes a scuffed F‑rank provisional card once (no speech about ladders).
* **Competence shown:** Observation > sprinting; negotiation > violence.
* **Resource rule:** Snacks = fuel; eating improves performance (establish the cost that will matter once **Evermind** wakes).

---

## Props & tools in play

* **Skewers / dumplings** (running motif + practical bait).
* **Notebook** (three bullet notes; clean habit).
* **Feather sketch** (silent pin on the board).

---

## End state of Chapter 1

* Small question resolved: purse returned; kid unharmed.
* New pressure introduced: extortion at Quay Nine, fire bell ringing now.
* Reader knows the promise: clever street‑level investigations with warmth, humor, and rising danger; next chapter kicks straight into the arson chase and the head injury that changes everything.
