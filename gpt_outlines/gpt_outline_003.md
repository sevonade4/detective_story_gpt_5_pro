# Chapter 3 — Outline: “Ash, Door, Egg”

## Chapter goal

Haruto returns to Quay Nine in daylight to make good on his promise—gather usable evidence, not names—and accidentally finds the humming egg that will become Mochi. He chooses secrecy, pocketing the egg and setting up Chapter 4’s “do I report this or feed it” dilemma.

## Setting & tone

* **Where:** Greyreach docks (Quay Nine), Rope Lane service alley, the scorched warehouse shell, Naomi’s stall edge.
* **When:** Morning after the fire (wet cobbles, steam still rising; echo wire back to normal).
* **Tone:** Street‑level procedural with quick, dry humor; steady Evermind problem‑solving; one warm, weird discovery.

## Cast on stage

* **Haruto Sato** (POV)
* **Naomi Kuroda** (brief: fuel & fuss)
* **City Watchman, chipped tooth** (evidence > names)
* **Dock Lions** (offscreen pressure; one look‑in)

## Beat‑by‑beat

### 1) Check the scene, fuel the brain

* **Visual:** Bucket‑line chalk marks on doors, steam hissing from blackened wood, watch tape (rune thread) fluttering.
* **Action:** Haruto clocks exits first, then the crowd flow; Evermind hums clean but his body’s slow.
* **Naomi bit (comedy valve):** She intercepts him with a skewer and a glare.

  * *Naomi:* “Eat first. If you pass out I’m charging the watch for carting you.”
  * *Haruto (mouth full):* “Public‑private partnership. Noted.”
* **Purpose:** Reinforce **feed first or crash**; set tempo; show the docks’ post‑fire routine.

### 2) Rope Lane: mark → document → sample

* **Tar door:** The **chili smear** is still there; clean square where a plaque was pried off; scuff prints aimed at water escape.
* **Haruto’s method:**

  * graphite rubbing of the **cut ward** stroke pattern;
  * scraps a **wick residue** flake into paper;
  * sketches the lane with distances (“numbers before verbs” in notes).
* **Dock Lions shadow:** One lion‑badge tough lingers, clocking Haruto. No move, just the “we see you” pressure.
* **Micro‑line (Evermind):** *Three options: confront, report, ignore. Cheapest: report with receipts.*
* **Purpose:** Deliver the “picture instead of a name” he promised; keep Lions present without a fight.

### 3) Scorched warehouse: the hum under the ash

* **Entry:** With the watch’s okay to cross the threshold “for a minute”; Haruto times his path around weak boards (Evermind short‑horizon predictions).
* **Finds:**

  * fuse‑jar glass necks in a half‑melted satchel ring;
  * a **nest of singed straw** tucked behind a collapsed crate; heat shouldn’t still be there… but it is.
* **The egg:** Smooth, soot‑streaked, palm‑to‑forearm sized; **warm and faintly humming**—a tone that lines up with the Evermind’s new “click,” making his thoughts align like teeth on a gear.
* **Haruto beat:** He checks for glyphs, brands, traps. None. He wraps it in his still‑damp cloth and tucks it under his coat.

  * *Haruto (to himself, dry):* “If you’re evidence, please don’t hatch in my pocket.”
* **Purpose:** Seed Mochi; echo the Codex note that the egg is from a **crime scene** and imprints on Haruto.

### 4) Evidence handoff: useful, not noisy

* **To the watchman:** Haruto hands over the rubbing, residue, and a simple sketch; states facts cleanly.

  * *Watchman:* “No names?”
  * *Haruto:* “Better. Angles and a missing stroke.”
  * *Watchman (pocketing the rubbing):* “That we can file.”
* **Tension:** The watchman warns him—quiet—about the Lions asking for who “snooped.” Haruto keeps his answers boring.
* **Egg concealment comedy:** The egg hums exactly when the watchman pats Haruto’s coat to move him aside. Haruto coughs to cover it; Naomi bangs a pan at her stall, masking the sound by accident.
* **Purpose:** Show Haruto’s “Mark, don’t bark” creed in action; keep stakes grounded.

### 5) Exit before enter (again): choose secrecy

* **Alley retreat:** Haruto maps a low‑profile route home; checks the egg’s warmth with two fingers; it hums a little stronger as he passes a dumpling steamer.
* **Internal decision:** *Report living thing? Or protect it until I know what it is?* Cost‑benefit threads line up; secrecy wins—for now.
* **Tag (hook into Ch.4):**

  * *Haruto (thin smile):* “If food calms me… what calms you?”
    The egg gives a soft *vrmmm* as the steamer lid hisses. He looks at the steamer. He looks at the egg. **Cut.**

## Clues & logs (drop into his notebook on‑page)

* Cut‑ward **corner stroke**: clean knife line; trained sabotage.
* **Chili mark** intact; **plaque area**: 9×12 hand‑spans; screws sheared, not rusted.
* **Residue**: lamp‑oil wick flakes; jar‑neck glass pitted by fast heat.
* **Unnatural heat source** among soaked debris → **egg** (not logged; secret side note or omitted entirely).

## World drips to weave in

* Post‑fire city protocol (rune thread, chalk marks); echo wire clicking cautious status codes again.
* Watch pragmatism: “bring me pictures, not hero speeches.”
* Dock Lions’ badge tell (cheap pour seam) noted in daylight for readers.

## Comedy valves

* Naomi’s weaponized hospitality.
* The egg trying to hum at the worst possible time.
* Haruto’s deadpan about “public‑private partnership” and “don’t hatch in my pocket.”

## Stakes & progress

* **Small question resolved:** Was the fire an “accident”? No—documented sabotage + method.
* **New question raised:** Why is there a **warm, humming egg** at an arson site—and who put it there?
* **Progression visible:** Haruto’s methodology levels up (evidence kit improvisation, promise kept); Evermind used deliberately with the **feed‑or‑crash** rule in play.

## Closing image

Haruto slips into the lane with an ordinary coat and an extraordinary secret, steam from a dumpling cart curling around him like a question mark as the egg hums once, hungry.
