Below is a **beat‑by‑beat outline for Chapter 5** that’s rich enough to draft **1,500–2,500 words** in webnovel style. It keeps to the Codex canon (pre‑hatch egg, lunch decode start, Dock Lions pressure, “paper before names,” snack‑heavy pacing).

---

## Chapter 5 — **Lunch Codes**

**Chapter goal:** Start cracking the *Cookbook Courier Ledger* and tie the partial key (**bay = bell**, **cumin = canal**, **clove = court**) to real routes/timing in Greyreach.

**What gets answered this chapter (small question):** “Is the cookbook really a courier code?” → **Yes.** They extract a working subset and predict a midday handoff route.

**Hook into next chapters:** The decoded entry points to **a dusk run that intersects Quay Nine**—right where the extortion crew and arson trail live.

---

### Scene 1 — Kettle, Hum, and Prep (Haruto’s room → late morning)

**Purpose:** Re‑establish egg care protocol; set decoding intention; remind the reader of “deferred truth.”

* **Action beats**

  * Haruto does a **steam cycle (60–90 sec)** for the egg; cracks open Naomi’s packet so **aroma + warmth** keep the hum steady.
  * Checks his **notebook bullets** from Ch.4: *bay=bell; cumin=canal; clove=court; capitals = posts; blank lines = delays*.
  * Lays out tools: ledger, graphite, twine bookmark, two pencils (one blunt for margin marks), cheap map scrap of Greyreach canals.
  * **Calories check**: eats one dumpling before thinking too hard. *Focus rides on food.*

* **Evermind texture**

  * Internal voice frames the task as **“committee agenda”**: *Goal—turn kitchen words into a route. Cost—calories. Constraint—don’t spook the city.*
  * *Exit before enter* planned: after lunch at Naomi’s → bell post → lamp yard corner; worst case, rope ladder.

* **Micro‑dialogue cues**

  * *Haruto (to egg):* “You hum, I read. Division of labor.”
  * *Thought:* *Log first, file later. I’m not ready to write ‘dragon’; I am ready to write ‘responsibility’.*

---

### Scene 2 — Lunch at Naomi’s: “Eat First, Decode Second” (midday market)

**Purpose:** Put all players (Haruto, Naomi, Kenta) around the table; decode starts in earnest; Lions’ presence brushes the scene without full conflict.

* **Arrival & food cadence**

  * Naomi **bangs the pan (GONG)**; shoves skewers + soup; repeats: **“Food is a down payment on not being stupid.”**
  * Haruto’s Evermind visibly **levels** after a few bites; he stops fidgeting.

* **Ledger on counter (low profile)**

  * Kenta slips in with **Skewer Scouts knock: tap‑tap…tap** and a grease‑creased ribbon to mark today’s page.
  * They huddle with paper bowls as cover; Naomi stations a **steamer lid** over part of the ledger when strangers pass.

* **Decoding method (clear and simple)**

  * Confirm the **partial key** aloud:

    * **bay = bell** (when capitalized → **specific bell post**)
    * **cumin = canal** (route or switch to water path)
    * **clove = court** (pass the courthouse quarter/steps)
  * Agree on **format rules**:

    * **CAPS = stop at official post** (BAY = bell post stop; CLOVE = the court steps land‑mark, not just “near court”)
    * **blank line = delay/hold** (wait window; common in courier codes)
    * **Three‑spice strings** describe **sequence** (path + checkpoint + timing).

* **Work a sample entry (give the writer lines to use)**

  * Sample line in the ledger (you can show it in‑story as text):

    * `cumin  bay  (blank line)  CLOVE`
  * Their reading (spoken explicitly):

    * *Haruto:* “**Canal**, then **bell** timing, then **hold**, then **Court steps**. So: ride the canal until the bell rings, wait, then move to the court steps.”
  * Add a second sample where **BAY** is capitalized, plus a scribble “9” in the margin (Kenta noticed it earlier):

    * `cumin  BAY  9`
    * *Naomi:* “That looks like **Bell Post Nine**.”
    * *Haruto:* “Quay Nine. That fits the arson night traffic.”

* **Light tension**

  * Two **Dock Lions** drift past; one **taps Naomi’s tip jar** again. She meets his eyes. Haruto points at the **bucket‑line chalk** with a bland smile. They keep moving. *We’ll remember* look returns.
  * Naomi’s **pan GONG** covers a faint **egg hum** in Haruto’s coat. She doesn’t call it out; she slides another dumpling across as a coded *keep it calm*.

* **Dialogue beats**

  * *Kenta:* “If capitals mean posts, then this part—CUMIN CUMIN BAY—means ‘canal‑canal‑bell’? Double water cut before a ring?”
  * *Haruto:* “Two canal turns, then align to the bell. The blank line tells the runner to stall until the ring catches up.”

* **Mini‑win**

  * They isolate **two full strings** that map cleanly onto a **midday loop** (court ↔ canal ↔ bell), and **one evening string** pointing to **bell post Nine**.

---

### Scene 3 — Bell Post Cross‑check (short scene, brisk)

**Purpose:** Validate a piece of the decode without flashing the ledger.

* **Action beats**

  * Haruto approaches the **chipped‑tooth watchman** with nothing but **paper facts**: traffic patterns near **Quay Nine** during midday bells; asks if **midday triple ring** happens for dredge shifts.
  * Watchman: **“That we can file.”** Confirms **triple ring at midday** on dredge days; tonight has **a scheduled single ring** at dusk for barge clearance (*plausible civic rhythm; don’t over‑explain*).
  * He repeats the **Lions are sniffing** warning; tells Haruto to keep his head where **a vendor can hit it with a spoon**.

* **Dialogue beats**

  * *Haruto:* “I like paper before names.”
  * *Watchman:* “Names get loud. Paper gets patient.”

* **Note**

  * Haruto **does not** show the ledger. *Deferred truth* stays intact.

---

### Scene 4 — Street‑Corner War Room (near lamp yard fence; quick cover stop)

**Purpose:** Convert decode into a **testable route**; show Haruto’s mind mapping **without** superpowers beyond Evermind’s normal “committee” feel.

* **Action beats**

  * Using a **scrap map** and chalk, Haruto maps the **sample string**:

    * **cumin → bay (blank) → CLOVE**
    * A **loop**: Lamp yard canal path → **listen for bell** → **hold** at a side alley → **move** toward **Court steps**.
  * He assigns **roles**:

    * **Naomi** keeps the ledger under the stall (safer, believable cover).
    * **Kenta** watches the **lamp yard corner**—what runners actually do at blank lines.
    * **Haruto** takes a spot where he can **hear bells** and count **foot traffic**.

* **Comedic beat**

  * Kenta tries to christen the team “**The Ladle League**”; Naomi vetoes it with a face. Haruto suggests “**Skewer Scouts**” stays for the kids; adults have to **do paperwork**.

* **Internal note**

  * *Haruto’s thought:* *Numbers before verbs. Count rings before you chase boots.*

---

### Scene 5 — Field Test, Midday (no fights; confirm the code works)

**Purpose:** **Prove** the decode matches reality; seed a **dusk follow‑up** near Quay Nine.

* **Observation montage**

  * Describe the **three bells** (or pattern you chose) and **crowd behavior** changing. Keep it simple and visual: boatmen shift lines, a runner slows, a barrow pauses at the alley mouth.
  * Kenta signals from the corner (small hand sign you define now, e.g., **two fingers tap → hold; circle motion → move**).
  * A **courier** (cap pulled low, ordinary clothes) follows the exact **cumin → bay (blank) → CLOVE** sequence: takes the canal cut, **stalls at blank line**, then heads toward the **court steps**.

* **Shadow note**

  * Haruto spots a **Dock Lion** loitering where the runner **stalls**—not escorting, **observing**. He **does not engage**. He **marks** the man mentally: cheap iron badge with the **pour seam** on the mane.

* **Mini‑dialogue**

  * *Haruto (low):* “The book isn’t a rumor, it’s a clock.”
  * *Kenta (proud whisper):* “We just read time with soup.”

* **Evidence capture**

  * Haruto notes **shoe tread** style for the courier (contrast later with Ch.3 scuffs if you want): the man’s **left toe scuffs** on starts; **no heel drag** (different from plaque thief).
  * He writes: *midday string verified; dusk string pending; Quay Nine alignment likely true.*

---

### Scene 6 — Close, Plan, Hook (Naomi’s stall → Haruto’s room)

**Purpose:** Bank the win, log clean notes, set the **dusk objective** that leads into Ch.6–8 beats (feed → Lions pressure → copycat fire).

* **Wrap at stall**

  * Naomi slides **“for later”** food; tells Haruto to **not** bring trouble to her **chalk lane**. He agrees; she still **bangs the pan** as a warning drum when a Lion looks over.
  * Quick three‑way **debrief**:

    * **Confirmed:** spice strings map to **route + timing**.
    * **Risk:** two toughs **asking around** for a *“cookbook”* (Kenta report).
    * **Plan:** **Hide the ledger** inside an actual cookbook at Naomi’s for now; **only carry pages** copied by hand.

* **Haruto’s room, last beats**

  * **Egg care** again (steam + aroma); the hum steadies. He logs **today’s decode** in **clean bullets**:

    * *bay = bell; cumin = canal; clove = court (confirmed in field).*
    * *CAPS = official post stop; blank line = delay/hold.*
    * *Midday loop matches lamp yard → bell → court movement (observed).*
    * *Evening line references BAY with a 9 → likely **Bell Post Nine (Quay Nine)**.*
  * **Decision:** Check **Quay Nine at dusk** to see who owns the night route—**without** starting a fight.

* **Final hook**

  * As Haruto closes the notebook, the **distant bell** gives a **single dusk ring** test; the **echo wire** stutters back on.
  * **Knock at door:** **tap‑tap…tap.**

    * Kenta (whisper, breathless): “Two big boys are buying bowls and **asking who’s reading recipes out loud**.”
    * **End line (Haruto):** “Then we eat fast and keep our mouths closed. We watch the bell.”

---

## Insertable Dialogue & Internal Lines (ready to drop)

* “**Paper before names**. Names get loud. Paper gets patient.”
* “**Numbers before verbs**—count the rings, then we move.”
* *Was this a trap? It felt like a trap. But if I don’t go, someone else will—someone who won’t file it clean.*
* “**Food is a down payment on not being stupid**.” / “I’m paying in installments.”
* “The ledger isn’t a recipe. It’s **a city timetable** wearing an apron.”

---

## Props & Visual Anchors to Weave In

* **Ledger** with grease blooms; **steamer lid** cover; **bucket‑line chalk** stripe near Naomi’s stall.
* **Bell post** plaque numbers (glimpse a carved 9 near Quay Nine).
* **Dock Lion badge** with visible **pour seam**; they **tap** the tip jar.
* **Map scrap** marked with chalk arrows (canal cut, alley hold, court steps).
* **Kettle** and **dumplings** as egg care tools (no direct flame).

---

## Continuity Locks (don’t break)

* **Mochi has NOT hatched** yet; egg only **hums** and likes **steam + aroma**.
* **No Thread Sight** yet (first flicker is later).
* **No fights** initiated; Haruto follows **Mark, don’t bark** and **Pick battles you can finish**.
* **Deferred truth** stays: he does **not** report the egg yet; he **does** keep clean notes.

---

## Outcome / Gains From Chapter

* **Functional code key (partial):**

  * bay = bell (BAY = bell post stop), cumin = canal, clove = court; **blank line = delay**.
* **Validated route:** Midday **lamp yard → bell → court** loop matches ledger.
* **Lead for next beat:** **Dusk run intersects Quay Nine**; Lions hovering around the stall and looking for a “cookbook” tighten the fuse.
* **Relationship beats:** Naomi’s **trust** inches up (she shelters the ledger); Kenta earns **real tasks** (watch corner signals).

---

### Optional Padding (if you need more words)

* A short exchange where Naomi **camouflages** the ledger in an actual recipe book, writing a real noodle recipe on the first page to make it look harmless.
* Haruto **teaches Kenta** a two‑step **hand signal** set (hold/move), with a tiny comedy beat where Kenta keeps inventing cooler signals and Naomi shoots them down.
* A **thirty‑second weather shift** (mist to bright) that lets you describe how **rune‑lamps hum when wet** vs quiet when dry, tying into the bell audibility.

Use the six scenes to keep paragraphs short, **dialogue‑forward**, and always **clear**. Each scene has enough practical beats and talk to reach the 1.8–2.2k zone comfortably while hitting the promised lunch‑decode beat.
