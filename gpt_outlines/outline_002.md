# Chapter 2 — “Bell, Fire, and the Quiet Spark”

**Purpose of the chapter**

* Deliver the inciting cheat: **Evermind Engine** activates via head injury.
* Establish the **cost** (caloric burn) with a funny-but-serious hunger crash.
* Answer a small question: *Was Quay Nine’s blaze an accident?* → **No. It’s staged arson for extortion.**
* End with Haruto alive, sharper, starving, and staring at a trail he’ll follow in Ch.3.

**POV / Style**

* Tight third on Haruto. Present‑leaning past tense. Dialogue‑forward, quick internal monologue.

**Estimated length**

* 1,800–2,200 words.

---

## Scene 1 — Run to Quay Nine (Hook + Setup)

**Location/Time:** Quay Nine, moments after the canal fire bell (continuation from Ch.1).
**Cast:** Haruto; panicked vendors; Dock Lions silhouettes (no names yet).
**Goal:** Get eyes on the “collection,” confirm what’s really burning.
**Obstacle/Pressure:** Smoke, crowd flow, slippery stones, guards slow to respond.
**Action beats:**

* Haruto maps **exits before entering**: rope warehouse alley; boat steps; a low pier gap.
* He notes tells: lamp‑oil reek, stacked kindling too neat, a jar wedge at a door—*not* accidental.
* He spots three Dock Lions moving *against* the panic, doing headcounts at stalls.
* He picks a tail target with a cheap iron lion badge (mane pour line visible from Ch.1).
  **Dialogue seeds:**
* Vendor (coughing): “Fire shouldn’t climb like that.”
* Haruto (light): “Fires don’t climb. People stack ladders.”
  **Internal notes:** *Mark, don’t bark. Don’t swing at the crowd; squeeze the seam.*
  **World drip:** Echo wire clicks fall silent during major fires; bucket line forms from canal; rune‑lamps hum wetter when doused.

**Mini‑reveal (closes scene):** Haruto finds a simple oil‑soaked fuse line under a crate—**arson**.

---

## Scene 2 — The Chase and the Crack (Trigger)

**Location/Time:** Along moored boats and slick quay planks.
**Cast:** Haruto; a Dock Lion runner with a satchel.
**Goal:** Follow without being seen; get a look inside the satchel.
**Obstacle/Pressure:** Wet ropes, shifting planks, smoke gusts; runner cuts across a narrow gangplank.
**Action beats:**

* Haruto mirrors the runner’s angle, using moving people as screens (fast, smart footwork).
* A blast of heat and a shove from someone fleeing throws Haruto off‑balance.
* He slips on a tarred rope and **cracks his temple** on a mooring ring.
* Sound drops out; bell becomes a slow heartbeat; world narrows to breath counts.
  **Internal notes (italicized in draft):** *Stay awake. Count three exits. No—six. Why can I see six?*
  **Sensory cue for cheat:** A faint taste/smell memory—citrus peel and spice (*childhood “Quiet Spark” tonic*), then a cool “click” in his mind.

**Beat outcome:** He should blackout… but **doesn’t**. The **Evermind** lights.

---

## Scene 3 — Evermind Online (Power + Cost)

**Location/Time:** Same path; time feels stretched.
**Cast:** Haruto; the runner (ahead); a child trapped behind a fallen barrel; two vendors.
**Goal:** Test the new clarity; save someone while keeping the tail.
**Obstacle/Pressure:** Splitting attention; body lag behind brain; rising fire at a side door.
**Action beats:**

* Threads of possible moves “ghost” ahead—six tiny plans at once; Haruto picks the third.
* He kicks a chock to roll the barrel off the kid as he passes, shouts clean orders to two vendors to form a quick hand‑off (*dialogue moves plot, no exposition dump*).
* He times the runner’s rhythm to predict a look‑back; turns face away right on cue; stays invisible.
* **Cost hits:** stomach knots, vision sparkles. He crams **Naomi’s dumplings** mid‑sprint; hunger eases just enough.
  **Dialogue seeds:**
* Vendor: “Who put you in charge?”
* Haruto (deadpan, mouth half full): “Dinner did.”
  **Internal notes:** *Brain is a storm; legs are a donkey. Pace or crash.*
  **World drip:** Fire ward at a warehouse door is scratched—someone turned off a standard protection rune before lighting the place.

**Mini‑reveal (closes scene):** The satchel jingles like glass/metal—the runner’s carrying **fuse jars and coin**, not loot. Collection + arson kit.

---

## Scene 4 — Mark, Don’t Bark (Win a Small Thing, Not the War)

**Location/Time:** Narrow service lane behind rope warehouses.
**Cast:** Haruto; the runner; two more Lions entering from cross‑alley.
**Goal:** Get something actionable **without** a brawl.
**Obstacle/Pressure:** Outnumbered; body still wobbly; flames licking toward stacked tarps.
**Action beats:**

* Haruto notices a drip trail of chilli‑oil from his own dumplings on the satchel (accident turned tool).
* He “stumbles” against a hanging line; it swings, clipping the runner’s shoulder so the bag bumps a tar‑stained door—**leaving a red smear** (marking for later).
* He snaps a quick **mental map** of the lane network, then kicks a wedge that collapses a stack of wet nets between him and the other two Lions—soft barrier, no fight.
* He lets the runner go, eyes locked on the **red‑smeared door** and the route they took.
  **Dialogue seeds:**
* Lion (taunting): “Run along, guild boy.”
* Haruto (pleasant): “Already did. Twice.”
  **Internal notes:** *Choose the exit before you enter. Leave with more than you came with. Chili mark counts.*
  **World drip:** A city watch horn at last—late response; locals rely on themselves first.

**Mini‑reveal (closes scene):** On the jammed doorframe—**no feather mark yet**, but a **clean square where a plaque was recently removed**. Someone’s wiping tells.

---

## Scene 5 — Aftermath, Rules, Hunger (Button)

**Location/Time:** Quay edge as the bucket line wins; later, Haruto’s small room.
**Cast:** Haruto; Naomi (arriving breathless with a wet cloth); a tired watchman (brief); background neighbors.
**Goal:** Cement Evermind rules; pick a next step; pay off the small question.
**Obstacle/Pressure:** Calorie debt crash; concern from Naomi; temptation to overexplain the brain thing.
**Action beats:**

* Haruto reports the **staged fuse** to the watchman in simple terms (“jar, wedge, scratched ward”), not accusing Lions by name—*mark, don’t bark.*
* Naomi notices the dried blood at his hairline; presses food into his hands on instinct.
* Back in his room, he writes crisp bullets (show progression via **notebook habit**):

  * “Quay Nine—**not** accident; fuse jars; ward scratched.”
  * “Runner route → lane with tar door (red smear).”
  * “Cost: thinking drains fuel fast. Bring food or crash.”
  * “No feather sign tonight. Don’t force pattern.”
* He tries to sleep; **Evermind won’t tire**—mind keeps sorting; body exhausted. He eats again and rides the edge to rest.
  **Dialogue seeds:**
* Naomi (flat): “If you die hungry, I will chase your ghost with a spoon.”
* Haruto (soft): “I’ll budget for that.”
  **Internal notes:** *If the mind doesn’t sleep, feed the body first. New rule.*
  **World drip:** Joiner’s metronome snore resumes across the alley; echo wire resumes clicks—normalcy after alarms.

**End image:** Haruto’s window lit by the rune‑lamp’s wet glow; his **bullet list** ends on a line that sets up Ch.3: “**Return by daylight. Check that door.**”

---

## Running gags to include (lightly)

* **Hunger jokes** that double as survival: tactical snacking saves lives mid‑scene.
* Haruto’s **“committee in my head”** line lands differently now that the Evermind is real.

## Foreshadowing seeds (soft, not shouted)

* The scent/taste memory (citrus + spice) when the Evermind turns on → **childhood Quiet Spark** tonic. No explanations yet.
* **Clean square where a plaque was removed** hints at a hidden network standard. (Later tied to Pale Quill logistics.)
* The neat kindling stack and scratched ward → **someone trained the Lions**; they didn’t invent the method.

## What this chapter answers

* **Small question:** Accident or arson? → **Arson.**
* **Next hook:** A marked door and a daytime follow‑up → **leads directly to the egg scene in Ch.3**.

## Props/Details to keep consistent

* Cheap iron lion badge (mane pour line) on at least one thug.
* Dumplings (sesame + chilli oil) as both fuel and accidental **tracking dye**.
* Notebook bullets at the end (clear, minimal, 3–5 lines).
