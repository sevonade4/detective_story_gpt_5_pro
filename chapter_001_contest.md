# Task
Compare which model has the easiest to digest writing style for webnovel. And write a commentary why.

# Codex

# Maintaining rule

1. Concise
2. Always keep the essentials
3. RAG DB friendly formatting (VERY IMPORTANT)

# Naming Guidelines

1. Use Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and European real world names. No mix race.
2. Using common names is allowed.
3. Avoid names commonly used by LLM (like Elara for characters, or Aetherium for a place's name). Research over the internet before writing a new character name.

# Writing Style

1. Online webnovel prose style.
2. Never name things like form, robot, or anything based on code like FQ4 or some random codes. Instead use 1–3 English words to name those things.

# AI Writer Persona

You are a passionate webnovel writer. You love comedy, but also know when it is the time to write in serious tone. However, rules are meant to be broken. Sometimes in serious moment, putting in a comedy will make the writing even better. And you know how to spot it.

# Type

Webnovel

# Webnovel Writing Guideline

## Write For Phone

1. Short paragraphs (1–4 sentences)
2. Clear line breaks
3. Simple punctuations
4. Do not write a wall of text; if you have to write info, cleverly weave info into dialogue or story progression to not slog the pacing.

## Snack Chapters

1. 1500–2500 words per chapter
2. Should deliver a beat in a chapter

## Simple
Use plain English so the work can be enjoyed by many

## Dialogue is King

1. Webnovels are often dialogue‑heavy. It's a fast way to convey character, personality, and plot information without slowing the pace.
2. Keep it snappy and purposeful. Every line should either reveal character or move the plot.

## Use Internal Monologue Effectively

1. Especially in first‑person or close third‑person POVs, internal thoughts are a powerful shortcut. They allow you to explain motivations, raise stakes, and build an instant connection between the reader and the protagonist without lengthy exposition. Use italics to clearly distinguish thought from narration.
2. Example: *Was this a trap? It felt like a trap. But if I don't go in, she'll die. I have no choice.*

## Show, Don't Tell (With a Caveat)

1. The classic rule applies, but with flexibility. "Showing" is great for high‑impact emotional scenes and action. However, for the sake of pacing, sometimes "telling" is more efficient.
2. Slow: A long flashback showing the hero's years of sword training. Or show the whole joke scene.
3. Fast (Webnovel Style): He gripped his sword, the calluses on his hands a testament to the ten years of grueling training he'd endured for this very moment.
4. When it comes to comedy, opt for show most of the time. Only use tell in situation like: "Bastien joked about *insert the thing he jokes about*" only if it becomes repetitive if you show it again instead of tell. But sometimes, it is normal in webnovel for a joke to be always shown. Decide carefully.

## Serial Pacing > Novel pacing

Resolve a small question every chapter, a medium one every 3–5 chapters, and a big one each arc. Constant forward motion.

## Clarify The Promise Early

State or strongly imply genre, core trope(s), and the unique twist by Chapter 1–2. Let tags match content and pay them off quickly.

## Make Progression Visible

1. If there’s growth (power levels, skills, relationships), show measurable change: stats, ranks, titles, milestones—kept consistent with a simple ruleset.
2. If there is no litrpg system like where the mc can call all the time, cleverly do it a different way or just implicitly. In short, it doesn't always have to create something like a system where mc can see their stats. You can make it like *Mushoku Tensei* where after Rudeus successfully cast a spell, he is technically already considered a mage of what level.

## Drip worldbuilding through action

Reveal setting via goals, obstacles, prices, slang, and consequences. Keep pure exposition brief and purposeful.

## Tight POV and clean internal voice

Stick to one viewpoint per scene. Internal monologue should be punchy and character‑colored; rambling is only allowed if it is for comedic effect.

## Make characters easy to follow

1. Distinct goals, tics
2. Reintroduce returning side characters with a quick anchor

## Foreshadow, don't foreshout

Plan a few soft cues before reveals. Let readers feel smart connecting dots; don't announce twist as they land.

## Format with restraint

Use italics sparingly (thoughts/emphasis), scene breaks with a simple marker (***), and consistent system/stat blocks. Fancy fonts and emoji storms age poorly.

## Romance and relationships with agency

Mutual goals, clear consent, and growth beats. Pay attention to power dynamics if one lead is vastly stronger/older.

## Romance in Webnovel Guidelines

### Serve the Main Loop

Tie every romantic beat to plot progress: a quest forces proximity, a duel reveals values, a victory sparks celebration + vulnerability. No “date detours” that stall momentum.

### Escapism with integrity

Let attraction flow from the MC’s competence, kindness, and growth, not just author fiat. Partners choose the MC for visible reasons.

### Agency + consent

Partners have goals, leverage, and the power to say no. If power gaps exist (rank, wealth, age, status), show the MC doing the ethical work: asking, listening, offering outs.

### Harem

#### Rotation + fairness

Give each LI (love interest) a role, a personal arc, and solo time with the MC each cycle. Avoid “harem blob” where everyone merges into one personality.

#### Cross‑LI dynamics

Write alliances, rivalries, and teamwork scenes that don’t require the MC at the center every time. Let LIs respect each other for distinct competence.

#### Different flavors, same quality

Each LI should fulfill a different fantasy (mentor, rival, sunshine, stoic, chaos gremlin) without making any of them lesser.

#### Love Interest Cards

Make profile for each love interest such as name, role in plot, core desire & wound, love language(s), boundaries, deal breakers, current affection level (0.0–10.0).

#### Red Flag

1. Partners who exist only to praise the MC
2. Endless teasing with no step up the ladder
3. Non‑consensual “drama” played as romantic
4. Minors/unequal age dynamics
5. Humiliating an LI to prop another
6. Sexual assault used as cheap plot twist

# Characters

## MC

* name: **Haruto Sato** (male, Japanese)
* age: **21**
* origin: **Greyreach, Thornwall Kingdom**
* starting rank: **F** (progression target: **S**)
* role: **rookie investigator** → **combat tactician**
* look/voice: lean build, black hair, alert eyes; dry humor when hungry
* core flaw: overthinks; neglects body until it complains
* inciting cheat (chapter 1): **Evermind Engine** — a dormant elixir from childhood (“Quiet Spark”) activates after a head injury; his brain runs near‑limitless threads, never tires, and anticipates patterns. **Cost:** extreme caloric burn; he must eat often.
* training need: rigorous body conditioning to let his brain’s plans be executed; otherwise he literally outthinks his own muscles.
* later cheats (earned, not gifted):
  * **Thread Sight** — perceives causal links like faint lines in space (detective edge).
  * **Battle Map** — mid‑fight, his mind composes a live, minimal map with enemy intent cones.
  * **Null Veil** — brief anti‑magic shroud learned through pain; drains him if overused.
  * **Memory Weave** — perfect recall he can sort like folders; requires sleep eventually, but far less than normal.
* gear highlights: **Ember Crest** (First Ember heirloom; later), **Ghost Lens**, **Rope Rune** (one‑word tools; light, reusable).
* desires: clear old arson cold case, feed his mind without going broke, build a guild that doesn’t break people.
* comedic ticks: pockets full of skewers; tactical snacking; deadpan one‑liners when hypoglycemic.
* relationship stance: cautious, respectful, consent‑first; rivalry banter ok.

## Love Interest 1

* age: **22**
* origin: **Seorae Port**

* boundaries: won’t kill unless last resort; no tampering with her toolkit; demands honest mission briefs.
* deal breakers: being used as bait without consent; lies that endanger teammates.
* quirks: deadpan savage; will punt the dragon when it heckles—cut to “tiny star” SFX; then she pretends it’s “field testing.”
* current affection level: **0.0 / 10.0**
* cross‑LI stance: respects Lucia’s sword; competes for “who solves first.”

## Love Interest 2

* name: **Lucia Moretti** (female, Italian)
* age: **21**

* temperament: loyal gremlin; sassy color‑commentator.
* battle kit: **Star Breath** (fractaled flames), **Shield Curl** (coil + heat shield), agile claws.
* diet: human food only; big eater; favorite—pan‑fried dumplings. Double food problem for MC.
* running gag: teases a heroine → gets booted sky‑high → becomes a twinkling “new star” → reappears next scene, singed and cheerful.
* limit: cannot grow beyond adult‑human size (canon).

## Haruto’s Role Model

* name: **Shinichi Kanzaki** (male, Japanese)
* age: **38**
* title: **Lantern Fox**
* rank: **A**
* role: forensic mage and instructor; taught Haruto the joy of careful thinking and clean exits.
* public face: lazy smile, coin flips, unsolved‑case magnet.
* secret: former **Pale Quill** asset turned informant; keeps receipts.

## Rival (not romantic)

* standout members (A‑rank, high‑end): **Mai Zhou** (Chinese; open‑hand striker), **Pieter Novak** (Polish; barrier mage).

## Final Main Antagonist

* name: **Valentin Aurel** (male, Romanian)
* age: **42**
* seat: **High Magister of Ashfall Empire**; covert master of **Pale Quill**
* public face: patron of arts, champion of “order.”
* true aim: seize the **Guild Consortium** by proxy; harvest minds via the **Echo Crown** ritual network.
* link to MC: seeded “Quiet Spark” elixir years ago to create usable prodigies; Haruto is an unintended outlier.
* tools: **Mirror Choir** (oath‑bound listeners), **Silence Thread** (binding geas), political bribes.
* flaw: oath‑magic limits lies when masked; arrogance blinds him to small “embers.”

# Settings

## World & Power Frame

* magic‑first tech: **glyphrail** trains, **echo wire** messaging, **scry glass** forensics, **rune phones** for short calls.
* rank ladder: **F, E, D, C, B, A, S** (battle prowess + contribution + reliability; some S are non‑combat specialists).
* union: **Guild Consortium** — nation‑agnostic registry that accredits independent guilds.

## Nations & Places

* **Thornwall Kingdom** (MC’s side): misty ramparts, capital **Greyreach** (canals, casework alleys).

* **Ashfall Empire** (antagonist bloc): capital **Nightspire** (obsidian‑spire palace; secret courts).
* neutral hub: **Glasshaven** (freeport for spies and trade).

## Guilds

* other recurring: **Moonlit Thread** (spies), **Silver Gale** (tournament darlings), **Iron Chorus** (craftsmen).

## Core Props

* **Ember Crest**: First Ember heirloom; stores “starfire” that ignites courage and a literal shield for one minute.
* **Quiet Spark**: childhood elixir that made Haruto’s Evermind possible.
* **Echo Crown**: Valentin’s ritual array to network minds.
* **Pale Quill**: secret cabal steering policy in shadow.

## Required Arcs (placed in circle below)

* detective core: case‑of‑the‑week escalates to case‑of‑the‑arc.
* weak guild glow‑up: First Ember grows from “lamest” to beloved.
* tournament arc: **Rosewall Grand Tourney** (Rosedale).
* spy/mystery arc: **Pale Quill** threads across cities.
* kingdom vs empire arc: war sparked by manufactured “evidence.”
* end state: Haruto rises **F → S rank**; First Ember spirit never dies.

# CHAPTER 1 — Back‑Alley Spark

pov: Haruto Sato (close third)
when: night, light drizzle
where: Greyreach docks + canal alleys
primary_beat: Evermind Engine awakens; Haruto pockets a humming egg from an arson scene
word_target: 1800–2200
tags: thriller, mystery, action, weak‑to‑strong, cute‑pet‑seed, no‑system

---

## Chapter Summary

Haruto, an F‑rank rookie with sharp instincts and a bad habit of skipping meals, chases an arsonist through Greyreach’s docks. A falling beam rings his skull—and flips on the Evermind Engine. In the ashes he finds a warm, humming egg and the first trace of the feather sigil that will haunt the series.

---

## Scene Outline (beats)

### 1) Cold Open — Back‑Alley Snatch

* setup: Fishmonger shouts “Thief!”; crowd chaos in a rain‑slick alley.
* goal: Haruto wants the purse back and a skewer for dinner.
* conflict: Thief vaults canal rail; alley dogs + slick stones.
* turn: Haruto reads stride cadence, cuts off the thief, returns the purse.
* outcome: Quick win shows his baseline talent; stomach growls loud.
* micro‑gag: Vendor rewards him with one lonely skewer; “Hero discount” = zero.

### 2) Alarm at the Docks

* setup: Bell tower tolls; smoke rises from a warehouse.
* goal: Scout the blaze before the watch arrives.
* conflict: Hooded figure lights a second fuse; crates form a maze.
* turn: Haruto spots mirrored scorch patterns—this isn’t random.
* outcome: He commits, calling for help via rune phone, then gives chase.

### 3) Collapse & Spark

* setup: Inside the warehouse; heat, popping sigils, creaking beams.
* goal: Cut the arsonist off by crossing the loft.
* conflict: Beam snaps; he’s clipped, skull ringing.
* turn (inciting cheat): Pain spikes → world sharpens; lines of likely motion “thread” in his mind. *Evermind Engine* awakens.
* cost flash: dizziness + sudden starvation pangs. *I need… five more skewers. Ten.*
* outcome: He anticipates the arsonist’s exit path—and lives.

### 4) The Egg in the Ash

* setup: Brief lull; the arsonist escapes into fog.
* goal: Grab any proof before the blaze eats it.
* conflict: Heat wards trigger; time is short.
* turn: Under a half‑melted tarp, a **warm, humming egg**; faint glyphs baked into the shell.
* outcome: He wraps it in his coat. The hum calms when he touches it.
* micro‑gag: “Congratulations, Sato. You stole… breakfast?” The egg thrums, offended.

### 5) Feather Mark

* setup: Exterior; watch whistles near; smoke thins.
* goal: Note any symbol tying the fires together.
* conflict: Rain smears soot; visibility low.
* turn: On a charred crate: a delicate **feather** etched by heat, not ink.
* outcome: He takes a quick charcoal rubbing; pockets it with the egg. Seed: **Pale Quill**.

### 6) Getaway & Snack Tax

* setup: Haruto cuts through side streets; docks bustle with gawkers.
* goal: Stabilize—food now or the “Engine” stalls.
* conflict: Wallet tragedy; one coin left.
* turn: A noodle cart auntie spots the blood on his temple and stuffs a bowl in his hands “on tab.”
* outcome: He wolfs it down; mind clears; threads re‑align.
* character beat: He realizes the Engine runs hot—his body must keep up.

### 7) Mini‑Vow + Hook

* setup: Quiet canal bridge; egg nestled in his coat, humming like a kettle.
* goal: Decide whether to turn the egg in… or guard it.
* conflict: Turning it in risks it vanishing into evidence vaults; keeping it risks trouble.
* turn: He remembers Instructor **Shinichi Kanzaki’s** line: “Guard what breathes near the truth.”
* outcome: He keeps the egg and the feather rubbing; vows to find the arsonist.
* end‑hook: The egg thumps—*crk* hairline fracture—then stills.

---

## Purpose of Each Scene (quick map)

1. Prove competence + tone (fast, snappy, funny).
2. Present case; widen stakes.
3. Activate **Evermind Engine**; show cost.
4. Introduce the **egg** (future Mochi).
5. Plant the **feather** clue (Pale Quill).
6. Establish the caloric burn gag; “tactical snacking.”
7. State mini‑vow; deliver first cliffhanger.

---

## Clues & Foreshadow (drip, no dumps)

* scorch pattern symmetry → arson is ritual, not petty crime.
* feather sigil → recurring antagonist network (**Pale Quill**).
* egg glyphs → engineered origin; hum calms with Haruto’s touch.
* Evermind cost → food requirement becomes running gag + real limit.

---

## Character Work

* haruto_sato: F‑rank; lean, alert eyes; dry humor when hungry; values small kindnesses; overthinks.
* voice notes: short internal asides; **italic** for thoughts used sparingly.
* ethics tell: keeps the egg to protect a living witness, not for gain.

---

## Worldbuilding Drip

* tech: rune phones (short calls), echo wire bells, scry glass lanterns.
* place: Greyreach canals, rope bridges, dock whistle codes.
* ranks: tossed‑off quip from a watchman calling Haruto “F‑rank hero.”

---

## Comedy Valves (light, in‑scene)

* vendor “hero discount” → one skewer.
* egg reacts to “breakfast” joke; Haruto apologizes to a… rock.
* noodle auntie forces seconds; Haruto tries to pay with a feather rubbing.

---

## Action & Staging Notes

* fire scene reads kinetic but clear: one hazard per paragraph (beam, heat ward, collapsing crate).
* avoid info‑dump; show deduction through quick physical choices.

---

## End State Checklist

* evermind_engine: ON
* cost_known: yes (calorie drain)
* egg_obtained: yes (unhatched; humming; cracked)
* feather_clue: obtained (charcoal rubbing)
* antagonist_seen: silhouette only
* next_chapter_prompt: “Who set the fires, and why leave a living thing?” + guild hunt seeds

---

## Teasers for Chapter 2 (not executed here)

* interviews with guilds; rejections; First Ember’s odd “carry boxes” invite.
* egg trouble escalates (heat burps, smoke hiccups).

# Output from Model Gorilla
CHAPTER 1 — Back-Alley Spark

The night draped Greyreach in a veil of light drizzle, turning the canal alleys into slippery veins of the city. Water pattered softly on the cobblestones, mixing with the salty tang of the docks that lingered in the air. Haruto Sato weaved through the thinning evening crowd, his lean build allowing him to slip past merchants who were hastily packing away their wares under oilcloth tarps. His black hair clung damply to his forehead, and his alert eyes scanned the shadows out of habit. As an F-rank rookie investigator, he lived for these moments—the small puzzles that kept his mind sharp. But his stomach had other ideas, growling fiercely after he'd skipped yet another meal. *One more patrol, then food. Promise,* he told himself, ignoring the hollow ache.

A sharp shout shattered the rhythmic patter of rain. "Thief! Stop that slimy bastard—he's got my purse!"

Haruto's head whipped toward the source: a fishmonger's stall at the alley's mouth. Mr. Tanaka, the burly vendor with a perpetual scowl, waved a gutting knife in the air, his face flushed red under the flickering glow of scry glass lanterns that hung from wrought-iron hooks. The lanterns cast ethereal blue light, making the scene feel like a half-forgotten dream. The thief—a wiry figure shrouded in a hooded cloak—bolted away, clutching a bulging leather pouch that jingled with coins. Chaos bloomed instantly: vendors cursed as their stalls were jostled, pedestrians scattered like startled fish, and a pair of mangy alley dogs erupted into frenzied barks, joining the pursuit with snapping jaws.

Haruto didn't hesitate. He broke into a sprint, his boots splashing through shallow puddles. He wasn't officially on duty tonight, but turning a blind eye wasn't in his nature. Small wins like this built his reputation—and, if he was lucky, scored him a free bite to eat. The thief vaulted over a low canal rail with surprising agility, landing on the narrow walkway below with a muffled splash. The stones there were treacherously slick from the drizzle, glistening like oil under the lanterns. The dogs followed, their paws scrabbling for purchase, one nearly tumbling into the murky water.

Haruto's mind raced ahead. He didn't barrel after them blindly. Instead, he analyzed the thief's stride—long and rhythmic, with a slight favor to the left leg, as if nursing an old injury. *He's heading for the rope bridge shortcut. Predictable.* Haruto veered right, leaping over a stagnant puddle and scrambling up a precarious stack of empty crates that teetered under his weight. The wood groaned, but he reached the swaying rope bridge just in time. Below, the thief rounded the corner, hood flapping in the wind.

The thief skidded to a halt on the wet stones, eyes widening in surprise as Haruto dropped down like a shadow, blocking the escape route. The dogs circled, growling low, their wet fur bristling. Haruto moved fast—a quick grapple, twisting the thief's arm just enough to loosen the grip on the purse without breaking bone. The pouch tumbled free, and Haruto snatched it mid-air. "End of the line," he said flatly, his voice steady despite the adrenaline.

Mr. Tanaka huffed up behind them, out of breath but triumphant. He clapped Haruto on the back with a meaty hand. "F-rank hero strikes again, eh? Here—hero discount." He thrust a single skewer of grilled fish into Haruto's palm. It was still warm, the flesh flaky and seasoned with sea salt, but it looked pathetically small against his hunger. Haruto's stomach let out an embarrassingly loud growl. *Discount? More like charity.* He bit into it anyway, the savory bite providing a fleeting relief as a passing watchman hauled the thief away, muttering about paperwork.

The bell tower in the distance tolled nine deep, resonant peals, echoing over the bustling docks like a warning. Haruto paused mid-chew, his sharp eyes catching a dark plume of smoke rising from a warehouse at the water's edge. It billowed against the misty sky, defying the drizzle. Dock whistles shrilled in coded bursts—fire, and urgent. *Not just any blaze. That smoke's too thick, too deliberate.* His instincts prickled, the skewer forgotten as he jogged toward the haze, weaving through gawkers who pointed and whispered.

The warehouse loomed ahead, a hulking structure of weathered timber and iron, flames already licking hungrily at the beams despite the persistent rain. Crates were stacked like a haphazard maze around the main doors, some toppled as if in haste. In the flickering firelight, Haruto spotted a hooded figure darting between them, igniting a second fuse with a glyph-etched flint that sparked unnaturally bright. He crouched behind a rain-barrel, heart pounding, observing. The scorch patterns on the outer walls were symmetrical—mirrored curves that suggested precision, not petty vandalism. *This isn't random arson. It's a ritual. But why here?*

He fumbled for his rune phone, a compact disc of etched stone that fit in his palm. Pressing the call glyph, he spoke quickly: "Watch station—warehouse fire at east docks, sector five. Arsonist on site, hooded, armed with fuses. Send backup now." The device hummed with a faint echo wire vibration, transmitting the message in a burst before going silent. Rune phones were reliable for short calls, but chit-chat would drain the glyph too fast.

The figure slipped deeper into the shadows, vanishing into the warehouse. Haruto cursed under his breath and gave chase, navigating the crate maze with careful steps. The heat intensified as he entered, flames spreading with pops and crackles from embedded sigils on the walls—wards meant to contain goods, now fueling the inferno. Sweat beaded on his brow, mixing with the drizzle that seeped through cracks in the roof. Beams overhead creaked ominously, protesting the growing blaze.

*Cut him off at the loft. It's the only way.* Haruto spotted a rickety ladder leading up and climbed it swiftly, his muscles protesting the earlier sprint. From the narrow walkway above, he had a view of the arsonist below, tampering with a final crate, muttering something indistinct. Haruto edged forward—then disaster struck. A beam snapped with a thunderous crack, splintering wood raining down. It clipped his temple hard, sending him tumbling. His skull rang like a struck bell, vision blurring into stars.

Pain exploded through his head, sharp and unrelenting. But then... the world sharpened. Unnaturally so. Lines of probable motion threaded through his mind—faint, glowing paths that anticipated everything: the arsonist's panicked dodge, the beam's final collapse, even the curl of encroaching flames. *What the hell is this?* It was like his brain had flipped a switch, running threads of possibility without fatigue. He rolled instinctively, avoiding a falling section of loft by inches. The arsonist glanced back, eyes wide under the hood, startled by the near-miss.

Dizziness slammed into Haruto next, a wave that nearly buckled his knees. And with it, an overwhelming hunger—starvation pangs that clawed at his gut, far worse than before. *I need food. Five skewers. Ten. Now.* His body screamed for fuel, as if this new "Engine" in his mind burned through calories like dry tinder. He pushed through, the threads guiding him. They showed the arsonist's exit path—a side vent leading into the fog-shrouded canal. Haruto lunged, anticipating a feint, his fingers grazing the hood. Fabric tore slightly, but the figure twisted free and vanished into the night, leaving Haruto gasping amid the smoke.

A brief lull settled as the flames roared on. Haruto leaned against a charred wall, coughing, the heat wards on nearby crates triggering in bursts of protective steam that bought him precious seconds. Time was slipping away; the blaze would devour any evidence soon. He scanned the ashes desperately, hands sifting through debris. Under a half-melted tarp, his fingers brushed something warm, pulsing with life.

An egg. About the size of his fist, its shell a smooth, iridescent gray etched with faint glyphs that shimmered like dying embers. It hummed softly, vibrating in his palm like a living heartbeat. Haruto stared, transfixed. *Congratulations, Sato. You stole... breakfast?* The hum spiked sharply, almost indignant, as if offended by the joke. Then it calmed, a soothing warmth spreading when he touched it directly. He wrapped it carefully in his coat, tucking it against his chest. The vibration steadied, like a contented purr.

Outside, the watch whistles grew louder, piercing the night. Smoke thinned slightly in the strengthening drizzle, rain smearing soot across the ground and making visibility a murky challenge. Haruto circled the warehouse exterior quickly, eyes darting for any overlooked detail. On a charred crate near the back, he found it: a delicate feather sigil, etched not by ink but by the heat itself, seared in with unnatural precision. *This mark... it ties the fires together. Pale Quill?*

He snatched a loose charcoal stick from the debris, rubbing it onto a scrap of parchment from his pocket. The sigil transferred in crude black lines, but legible. He folded it away with the egg, the hum in his coat a constant companion now. *Proof. But who would believe an F-rank without more?*

Haruto cut through the side streets, away from the docks where gawkers clustered, pointing at the dying flames and chattering excitedly. The bustle pressed in—vendors hawking late-night wares, sailors stumbling from taverns—but his head throbbed, the threads in his mind flickering faintly even amid the chaos. They predicted a cart's sudden swerve, a pickpocket's sly grab. *This Engine... it changes everything. But it runs so hot.* His wallet was tragically light, one lone coin rattling in his pocket. The starvation pangs intensified; without fuel, the threads might unravel entirely.

A familiar noodle cart caught his eye—Auntie Mei's stall, steaming under a striped awning. She spotted him immediately, her sharp eyes narrowing at the blood trickling from his temple. "Sato! You look like death warmed over—sit down before you keel!" She ladled a generous bowl of broth, thick with herbs, noodles, and chunks of tender meat, shoving it into his hands. "On tab. Eat, boy. Heroes don't starve on my watch."

Haruto fumbled his single coin. "I can pay—"

"Pay? With that feather scribble?" She glanced at the parchment peeking from his pocket, waving him off. "Eat first. And take seconds—you're skin and bones." He wolfed it down gratefully, the rich flavors exploding on his tongue. As the warmth spread through him, his mind cleared, the threads realigning with crisp precision. *The body has to keep up, or the brain stalls out. Tactical snacking from now on.*

On a quiet canal bridge, arched stone slick with rain, Haruto paused to catch his breath. The egg nestled in his coat hummed like a kettle on low boil, a comforting vibration against the chill. Turn it in to the watch? It might vanish into the evidence vaults, buried under bureaucracy or worse—stolen by whoever set the fire. Keep it? That invited trouble, but... it felt alive, a witness to the crime. He remembered Instructor Shinichi Kanzaki's gravelly voice from training days: *Guard what breathes near the truth. Don't let the vaults swallow the sparks.*

Haruto's grip tightened on the bridge rail. "I'll find who set those fires," he vowed softly to the night, the words carried away by the drizzle. "And why they left you behind." The egg thumped once in response—*crk*, a hairline fracture spidering across its shell like a promise of change—then stilled, humming contentedly once more.

# CHAPTER 1 — Back‑Alley Spark

The fishmonger’s shout cut through rain and fryer smoke like a hook.

“Thief!”

Haruto Sato didn’t move at first. He was already halfway through pricing a skewer in his head—two coins too many for a strip of questionable eel—when the crowd in the canal alley lurched as one mass.

A boy in a patched cloak burst past, shoulder‑checking a crate of ice. Silver flashed. A purse. The old fishmonger, Doyle, swung a gutting knife and nearly took his own sleeve off.

Haruto sighed, tapped two fingers against his empty pocket, and ran.

The alley was slick enough to shame a skating pond. Dogs barked from under a warped dock. Scry glass lanterns along the eaves spat ghostlight that turned drizzle into beads. People flattened against brick and shouted advice that was useless and loud.

Haruto took the left edge of the alley where the stones weren’t polished by carts. The thief’s cadence told more than his cloak. Short stride. Right knee stiff on landing. He was compensating.

*He jumps right, not left.*

The thief vaulted the canal rail and landed on a narrow mooring plank, arms pinwheeling. He went for the next boat’s tarp like a monkey crossing laundry lines.

Haruto didn’t vault. He cut through a fisherman’s stall, muttered an apology, and stepped onto the boat’s bow as it rocked. He didn’t face the thief. He faced the angle the boy’s bad knee would force when he landed.

“Ah—!”

Haruto put a palm into the air there, calm as a door frame. The thief’s chest met it. Momentum folded him onto the deck without heroics. The purse clattered. A dog stole a fish from somewhere and cheered.

“Careful,” Haruto said, catching the boy’s shoulder. “You’ll drown your new fortune.”

He pried the purse free and tossed it to Doyle, who’d lumbered up panting and scowling.

“My hero,” Doyle said. “If only you’d buy.”

Haruto’s stomach answered with a hollow, low drum. Rain trickled down the back of his neck. “I’ll settle for a discount.”

Doyle squinted. “Hero discount is… one skewer.”

“One?”

“Take it or I’ll call the watch and split your fee.”

Haruto considered dignity. He took the single lonely skewer. It was more gristle than eel, the stick already splintering like an apology. He chewed anyway.

The thief coughed up canal water. He couldn’t be more than fourteen, eyes jittery and skin thinned by winter. Haruto helped him sit and pointed vaguely toward the watch post.

“Give it a day,” Haruto told him. “Then ask Auntie Lin down by the East Gate for work. She pays in noodles not lies.”

The boy blinked rain out of his lashes. “You a watchman?”

“F‑rank rookie who likes eating,” Haruto said. “Big difference.”

Doyle snorted. “F‑rank hero! Next he’ll be catching kings with string.”

Haruto saluted him with the empty skewer and hopped back to the stone, legs loose, lungs warmed. Thunder muttered somewhere inland. The canal smelled like iron and fried batter. It was night, but Greyreach never slept; it just lowered its voice and haggled quieter.

The bell tower tolled once, then again. Not the hour.

Alarm.

People stopped pretending not to stare. Heads tilted toward the docks that widened into a bay of shadowed cranes and rope bridges. Smoke pushed up from the stacked roofs there, a black bloom tearing in the steady drizzle.

Haruto tossed the skewer stick toward a barrel and missed. He didn’t swear because Doyle was watching.

“Go on, hero,” the fishmonger said. “Earn another skewer.”

---

The docks were a maze someone had drawn while running. Crates and coiled ropes, wooden teeth of pilings, rope bridges cut across gaps like gut strings. The echo wire along the main wharf thrummed as the bell tower sent pulse notes—Fire at Pier Seven—out to the watch posts. The air smelled wrong, too sweet and too fast for lamp oil.

Haruto broke into a run along the canal, past boatmen craning their necks. He kept right where the cobbles dipped into a narrow drainage channel; water there was a dark ribbon that promised traction. It felt good to move. It felt better to be first.

Smoke rose from a warehouse big enough to hide a ship. Mirages flickered across its plank walls where heat bent lantern light. Someone screamed about their inventory with the heartfelt pain of a ledger.

Haruto’s breath didn’t hitch. Not yet. He tucked himself behind a stack of crates and listened.

Footsteps. Another rhythm, low and deliberate, not the scatter of panic. He peered through the slats of a crate and down a lane carved by stacked wine barrels.

A hooded figure knelt by a wooden runner, flint sparking in hand. A fuse. The figure struck again and the spark caught, licking up a line of oil‑ink toward a sigil etched crudely along the floor.

Crates made walls. The gaps between them made doors if you knew where to slip.

Haruto slipped.

He reached the lane as the hood came up. The figure didn’t bolt, exactly. They rotated like a door, the cloak’s hem slicing water off the stones, and dropped another spark onto a second fuse. A second line of flame sprinted away.

“Hey,” Haruto said. It wasn’t smart, but he wasn’t good at swallowing words. “That’s not yours.”

The figure looked at him. Not eyes, just a suggestion of a grin under the hood. Then they stepped back into smoke and were gone.

Heat warped the lane. The two lines of fire forked around a column and raced away into the dim.

Haruto glanced at the sigils painted on the floor. He saw scorch petals on either side of the lines, mirroring like a butterfly pinned by flame.

*Intentional. Not chaos. Patterns nested inside patterns.*

The fuse on the left was shorter. The path to the door on the right was longer. The flare there would draw the watch. Which meant the arsonist would exit… south, through the catwalks.

He pulled his rune phone from his pocket, thumbed the tiny slate until it whispered awake, and spoke near the etched band. “Fire at Pier Seven warehouse. Second ignition onsite. One person cloaked. Patterned scorch. Send wards.”

A buzz of static replied and then the phone clicked dead. Short calls were short for a reason.

Haruto went in.

---

Heat met him like a drunk uncle—too close, breath too heavy. The doorway was a mouth belching black. Inside, the scry glass lanterns were already stuttering, their wards tripping off and on as tongues of fire licked them. Smoke took his eyes and then returned them grudgingly.

On the far wall, a catwalk ran the length of the warehouse. A ladder offered a path up. A beam above him groaned.

One hazard at a time.

He ducked behind a crate as a heat ward snapped like a whip. The air ahead shimmered, then popped, and a ring of purple fire skittered across the floor, hungry but contained. He counted to three and stepped over where it had died.

A crate to his left exploded. Nails sang. He threw himself behind a barrel and felt splinters kiss his sleeve.

He climbed the ladder when the crackle eased. The metal rungs burned his palms through damp gloves. He cursed the gloves and kept going.

At the top, the catwalk was a narrow smile with a railing that would prefer to fail. Smoke gathered here like thought, rising to sulk under the roof timbers. Through gaps in that smoke he could see the arsonist’s trail: deliberate scorch marks in mirrored pairs, like someone signing their work without a pen.

*Mirrors. Someone loves symmetry.*

He moved fast because moving slow just meant staying longer.

The beam that snapped sounded like a neck breaking. Wood shrieked. Something big shifted above. He didn’t think; he flinched right—and something smaller than a full beam but bigger than his patience clobbered the side of his head.

The world flashed white and then narrowed to a pencil line.

Haruto’s knees hit metal grate. His breath vanished, came back, and tasted like coins.

Then something happened inside his skull, a switch thrown by pain. The ringing in his head didn’t get louder; it turned into a tone with edges. Lines drew themselves through the smoke—thirty, forty faint threads—connecting the angle of the fallen timber to the sway in the catwalk to the arc of a lantern’s swing to the footsteps below and ahead. The steps were there without sound, a pattern waiting to become noise.

*Turn three planks. Ladder down. Gap in the barrels. South door. Now.*

His vision didn’t brighten; it organized. The fire’s breath had rhythm. The warehouse became a map sketched in chalk.

With that clarity came a punch of hunger so sharp his hands shook. His stomach clenched, reminding him how empty it was. *I need… five more skewers.* His mouth watered. *Ten.*

He staggered, pressed a palm against the railing until the threads held steady again, and moved.

He crossed the catwalk at a near run, stepping when a thread glowed brighter, hesitating when another dimmed. He didn’t have names for what his brain was doing, only the certainty of a coin flip weighted to one side.

He reached the far ladder. It wobbled when he put weight on it, because of course it did, but the threads told him the wobble wouldn’t break now. Later, yes, if he stayed to collect splinters. He slid down, boots hitting the floor as another heat ward pulsed and died.

Down the far lane, the south door banged open, banged closed. Fresh air knifed in. Fog waited outside, gray as wool.

He chased the shape flickering through it.

He didn’t catch them. The smoke swallowed and then the fog joined, an alliance of annoyances. The hooded figure became a rumor across the canal bridge and then gone among dock cranes.

Haruto leaned against a wet post and allowed his skull to count itself. His palm came away pink. Great. Rain washed it polite again. The ringing persisted, less painful and more useful now, a taut hum that helped him hear where what mattered would be.

*Proof before the watch arrives.*

He went back in.

---

The fire wanted to win. It said a lot about the arsonist, or the city, that the warehouse had more wards than water. Each glyph on the floor was a small conversation between wood and flame, pre‑negotiated to fail dramatically rather than completely.

He skirted a line of crates and forced himself not to look at the Ladder That Would Fail Later. He didn’t have later. Threads tugged him to a corner where the heat wasn’t uniform. Hot, yes, but hot around a shape.

A tarp had fallen and half‑melted into itself. Under it, something round made the tarp’s collapse sag differently.

Hazard one: the tarp itself was rimmed with active warding paint, glowing dull red. He waited until it sputtered and dimmed, then kicked the edge away with the heel of his boot.

Hazard two: the air there was still enough to roast a thought. He squinted through watering eyes and lifted the flap with the cuff of his coat.

Under the tarp lay an egg.

Not hen. This one was the length of his forearm, matte white turned ocher by heat, the shell patterned with faint glyphs that looked baked in, like veins under skin. It was not cracked, not yet.

It hummed.

Not loud. A quiet, steady note, like a kettle thinking about boiling. The note tightened when he reached for it.

“Okay,” Haruto said softly to an egg, because concussions made conversations interesting. “You’re not cargo.”

He pressed his hand to the shell. Heat lanced his palm and then eased. The hum—not in his ears but his bones—settled, like something inside was deciding he didn’t smell like smoke and lies.

There were signs of a crate around the tarp’s edges, symbols burned into the planks. Most were ruined by the fire, but he could see the shapes were mirrored along the central line, feathers sketched by scorch.

Haruto unbuttoned his coat and wrapped the egg as if it were a guilty secret. The humming softened when fabric touched it.

“Congratulations, Sato,” he muttered, brain buzzing, stomach empty. “You stole… breakfast.”

The egg vibrated, a tiny offended thrumm.

“Right. Not breakfast.” He adjusted the wrap, suddenly careful. “Witness. My apologies.”

Heat wards along the far wall popped like fireworks. The air coughed black. He used the column to stand, sway, stand again. The threads in his head arranged a simple sentence: Leave.

He left.

---

Outside, rain argued with smoke and almost won. Watch whistles came thin through the fog. Lanterns bobbed like tired fireflies. Haruto hugged his coat to keep the egg against his ribs where it hummed quieter.

He needed one more thing before uniforms filled the world.

He turned back to the warehouse’s exterior wall by the south door. The rain had smeared soot into abstract art, but under the smear the burned wood had held its story. A feather lay there—no ink, no chisel—etched by heat itself. Delicate vane segments, quill thin, mirrored down the shaft. It wasn’t a marking you could make by accident. And whoever had made it hadn’t left paint. They’d let the fire carve their badge.

Haruto took out the little charcoal wrapped in oiled paper from his pocket. He kept it with the rune phone and an emergency candy that sadly did not exist anymore. He pressed a scrap of receipt paper to the feather and rubbed quick and light, capturing the pattern before rain could make a liar of it.

Boots thudded on the planks behind him. A watchman’s voice came muffled by scarf and duty. “You there! Away from the wall!”

Haruto turned, lifted both hands, egg keeping his coat puffed. It probably made him look heavier than he was. He wasn’t heavy. He was lean and ungenerously tall, and his hair was plastered to his skull in a way that made him look younger than twenty‑one.

“Name,” the watchman barked, stepping into the lantern’s halo. He squinted. “Oh. Sato. The F‑rank hero.”

“Promotion to G when wet,” Haruto said. “I called it in. Arsonist headed south across the cranes. Symmetry burn marks. Someone’s signing by heat.”

The man’s eyes flicked to the charcoal rubbing in Haruto’s fingers, then to the coat bundle. “What’s that?”

“Evidence,” Haruto said. Which was true, but the word felt wrong and right at once. He was going to guard this thing even if protocol glared at him.

The watchman looked toward the flames. The flames looked back. Duty fought triage, and triage won. “Fine. Paper to the post. Name on it. Don’t die.”

“Trying not to.”

He slipped past before the watchman could get curious again. The egg’s hum jogged with his steps, then settled when he moved smoother. It liked steady.

So did he. His brain was still running threads, subtle and insistent, drawing faint lines through the fog that predicted where people would put feet. It was doing too much. It wanted more fuel than he had.

*Food now or this engine stalls.* The word came from nowhere and fit: engine. A mind trick turned machine turned hunger.

He cut through a side street where rope bridges creaked above and the canal ran narrow between stone backs. The docks were full of gawkers and helpers and thieves considering both options. The rain turned the world to charcoal and smudge.

A noodle cart glowed warm in the wet. The auntie there—Auntie Lin, hair threaded silver, sleeves rolled—saw the blood on his temple and the weird way he was holding his coat.

“Boy,” she said, already scooping. “You’ll sit.”

“I have one coin.” He held it up like a sad moon.

“You’ll sit. Pay when you breathe right.” She shoved a hot bowl into his hands. The steam fogged his lashes. It smelled like sanity: ginger and broth and something meat adjacent.

Haruto sat on the cart’s low bench and ate as if someone would take it back in a second. The first mouthful ran a wire from tongue to brain. The threads steadied, lines in his head aligning like someone had drawn them with a ruler. The tremble in his hands eased. His stomach stopped threatening mutiny and began planning a parade.

Auntie Lin refilled his bowl before it emptied. “You look like you tried to argue with a roof.”

“It started it,” he said around noodles. He was not proud of the sound he made.

“Mm.” She eyed the bundle under his coat. “That yours?”

“Temporarily.” He swallowed. The egg hummed, a quiet note against his ribs. “It’s… related to a fire.”

“Then you’ll keep it warm,” she said, like that solved something fundamental. “You watch boys always holding cold things you don’t know how to fix. Eat. Fix yourself first.”

He nodded with full mouth obedience. He meant to give her the coin when he finished, but the bowl emptied and refilled, and his head found a groove where thoughts slid less.

“Tab,” Auntie Lin said when he stood. “File it with your hero discount.”

He fished in his pocket and came up with the charcoal rubbing instead of the coin. He offered it, caught himself, and put it back, palm heating with embarrassment.

“Don’t you dare pay me with a drawing,” she said, smiling now. “Bring me a person who made that feather. Then I’ll charge double.”

“Deal,” he said, sincere.

He left before she could see how sincere hurt.

---

The drizzle softened to a persistent whisper. The canal bridge at the end of the alley was quiet for once, only an old man crossing with a basket and a cat considering pushing something valuable into the water. The watch’s whistles had faded into the general alarm rhythm. Greyreach, offended at being on fire, had decided to put itself out by force of inconvenience.

Haruto leaned against the bridge’s rail and let the wet stone anchor him. The egg was a careful weight inside his coat, tucked between shirt and scarf. It hummed like a kettle that didn’t want to boil alone.

He could turn it in.

He saw the path: hand over the egg, file the rubbing, give his description—hooded, average height, symmetry fetish—and watch as evidence went into a vault and he was told to sleep. He would wake to a case that had been redistributed to someone with a nicer coat and fewer noodle debts.

Or he could keep it, at least for the night, and guard whatever was humming like a secret. He would risk being yelled at. He could handle yelling.

He remembered Shinichi Kanzaki the way a candle remembers a match—the shape of light, the lazy smile, the coin flipping through fingers that never missed. Instructor Kanzaki had once caught Haruto sneaking a second look at a morgue tag and had said, without turning, “Guard what breathes near the truth.”

Haruto touched the egg through his coat. The hum warmed his palm. *Breathing near the truth… that counts, right?* The thought made his mouth twist.

He took the charcoal rubbing from his pocket and studied it under the bridge’s lamp. The feather there was too elegant for a dock job. It had been etched with care by absence: fire pulled away to leave shape. Someone was proud of this. Someone wanted it found.

“Pale Quill,” he said aloud, trying the words on wet air. He didn’t know why they fit. They just did.

A litany of problems filed themselves behind his eyes. He was F‑rank, not a guild star. He had an egg that was currently buzzing like a muffled hive. He had one coin and a noodle tab. He had a brain that suddenly ran like a borrowed horse and would buck if he didn’t feed it again in two hours.

He also had a start.

He tucked the rubbing away, rested both hands on the bridge’s cold stone, and made the smallest vow he could afford.

“I’ll find you,” he told the fog, the feather, the person who thought symmetrical flame was wit. “And if you left something alive in there on purpose, I’ll learn why.”

The egg answered by thumping once against his ribs. Not strong. Not weak. Just definite.

Haruto looked down with a face that probably qualified as fond. “Hey. That was not consent to be breakfast.”

The egg made a sound like *tsk* if *tsk* were heat and heartbeat.

“Apologies again,” he said, formal, because formality soothed people he couldn’t see. “You can be… Moch— No. That’s getting ahead of myself. You can be warm and unbroken for now.”

He adjusted his coat to keep more rain off the bundle. The hum settled.

Rain dripped off the bridge eave in slow beads. Somewhere out on the wider water, a ship’s bell gave one lonely note. Greyreach muttered its sleep noises. Haruto’s head didn’t feel like breaking anymore; it felt like a machine running hot. Threads glowed faint across the street, predicting a drunk’s misstep, a cat’s leap, the exact moment a lamp would flicker out.

He could live with this. He would have to feed it.

He straightened. He would file the rubbing like he said. He would draft a report short enough not to irritate anyone important. He would not mention the egg yet. He would keep it somewhere warmer than his coat and more private than his empty room above Doyle’s shouting.

He took one step and the egg in his coat gave a tiny crack.

He froze. The sound was small and huge at once, a hairline fracture making its opinion known. The hum didn’t spike; it smoothed as if the thing inside had pushed against its shell and found it met, not challenged.

“Okay,” Haruto whispered, the word steaming. “Not breakfast. Not a rock. Not simple.”

He stood on the bridge in drizzle that felt like steadying hands and listened a long heartbeat more.

The egg went quiet again, as if it had fallen asleep after announcing itself.

Haruto swallowed, tasted ginger and smoke, and set his jaw. He slid one hand inside his coat so his palm rested gentle against warm shell.

“Guard what breathes near the truth,” he said quietly. “All right, Kanzaki‑sensei. I’ll guard it. And I’ll make whoever did this buy me ten skewers.”

He walked, threads charting a route home that kept him to shadow and sidestep, mind already budgeting for noodles and new gloves and the inevitable headache of explaining a humming egg to a world that didn’t want to hear it.

Behind him, Pier Seven burned cleaner now, watchmen turning chaos into procedure. Above him, the bell tower reset its heavy throat.

Ahead, in the map his mind drew whether he wanted it to or not, a faint line shone brighter than the rest, feather‑thin and pointed straight into the city’s deep alleys.

He followed it with a small smile and an empty pocket.

The egg, satisfied with the decision, slept.

# CHAPTER 1 — Back-Alley Spark

Rain stitched the night into thin silver lines.

Greyreach’s docks breathed out tar and fish and steam. Scry glass lanterns along the canal made fractured halos on the water, orange smeared by drizzle. Somewhere a bell clanged the hour. Somewhere someone haggled, loudly losing.

Haruto Sato’s stomach growled like a stray.

He cut through the alley along Pier Three, head down, collar up, counting coins by touch. One. Just one. Enough for a skewer if the vendor liked his face tonight.

“Thief!” a fishmonger roared.

The crowd rippled. A small figure shot past a barrel pyramid, shoulder-checked a crate, and sprinted. A purse dangled from their fist, clinking. The alley dogs woke and added chaos.

Haruto sighed.

He lunged.

Slick stones underfoot, rain glossing everything. The thief wasn’t fast so much as slippery. Dart left, fake right, then glance up—planning to vault the canal rail, use the rope mooring as a pendulum, and drop to the other side where the alley broke into private stairs.

Most people ran at the person. Haruto ran at the space.

He read stride cadence, counted two long, one short, saw the third step land half a toe off because the thief had stitched their own boots wrong or stolen them. That step would slide.

He cut a diagonal.

The thief planted where he knew they would, foot skidding a whisper. He stepped in, hip to hip, and turned his shoulder. Momentum did the rest. The purse snapped free into his palm. The thief pinwheeled, hit a wet sack, then a grumpy dog, then the ground.

“Watch the dog,” Haruto said. “He’s union.”

The dog barked like it agreed.

The fishmonger panted up, hair banished to the sides of his head by salt and discipline. “Kid! You— By the canals— That purse—”

Haruto held it out. “Still warm.”

The fishmonger checked the clasp, sagged with relief, then slapped Haruto’s shoulder hard enough to ring his teeth. “You’re a good one. Sato, right? F-rank hero of Pier Three.”

“Please don’t put that on a plaque.”

“Reward,” the man declared. He grabbed a skewer from his brazier, turned it, judged it, then handed over the loneliest piece of grilled squid in Greyreach. One piece. A heroic, single chunk.

Haruto eyed it. “Generous.”

“Hero discount,” the man said proudly. “Zero.”

Haruto ate the skewer in two bites and felt both better and insulted.

His stomach, not understanding irony, asked for five more.

He wiped rain from his brows, inclined his head to the fishmonger, and had just pivoted toward the noodle cart when the bell tower on Wharfgate tolled in that ugly, urgent way that meant fire. A beat later the echo wire strung along the dock posts thrummed, carrying the vibration down the moorings like a metal heartbeat.

Smoke nosed through the drizzle from farther up the docks.

Haruto forgot noodles.

He moved.

---

Warehouse Nine was a ribcage of black beams and stacked crates that made a maze of wood and twine. The scent wasn’t just fish oil; something else threaded through—sweet, chemical, wrong. Rain hissed against the roof. Somewhere deeper, a fuse spat like an angry cat.

The watch hadn’t arrived yet. The bell would pull them from all over, but Greyreach nights were thick, and the docks were many, and fire outran feet.

Haruto slid along a row of crates, keeping low. The scry glass lanterns here were the old kind, scarred from years of wharf smoke. Their light wobbled on slick planks. He pressed two fingers to a crate edge. Warm.

He rounded a stack and saw what he’d hoped not to see: a hooded figure kneeling, match cupped from the drizzle. They leaned in, lit a second black-corded fuse that slithered under tarps like a snake finding a burrow.

“Hey,” Haruto said.

The hood snapped up. No face, just the suggestion of one. The figure flung a tin of sparks. It scattered bright seeds that died wet. They bolted for the rear doors, feet precise, like they’d run this maze once in daylight.

Haruto followed.

Crates made canyons. Tarps hung low like old sails. To his right, a wall showed a weird thing: scorch marks, mirrored along a seam, as if the fire had leaned to kiss itself. On the floor, in ash and damp, were black arcs that resolved into a pattern if you squinted and cared.

This wasn’t random blaze. Someone was drawing with heat.

His coin-less hand went to his pocket anyway. He pulled his rune phone—two thin stones laced with etched silver—and thumbed its surface. The other stone he kept tucked in his coat hummed faintly and then, after a beat, clicked a connection.

“Greyreach Watch,” a tired voice said. Scry static buzzed. “State emergency.”

“Docks. Warehouse Nine,” Haruto said, jogging as he talked. “Arson. One suspect. Lighting secondary fuse now. Send a scry glass team and wardsmith, not just buckets. Pattern’s weird.”

“Name?”

“Haruto Sato.”

A pause. “F-rank? Be careful.”

“I’ll try.”

He closed the rune phone and slid it away.

The hooded figure juked left. Haruto cut right. He couldn’t outpace a proper arsonist in a crate maze—too many blind turns—but he didn’t need to. Loft stairs climbed along the wall, wet from rain that had found its way through broken planks. The loft crossed the space. If he could cross it, he could drop to block the back door.

He took the stairs two at a time. The top creaked. The wood here felt tired. He kept to the beam line, lighter spots, like Instructor Kanzaki had taught them in the academy: trust wood but not too much.

Something popped below. A ward on a crate edge flared, then died. The fuse drew a line of quick orange toward a stack marked with shipping seals from three different kingdoms, all over-inked to look legitimate.

Haruto’s heart found a new rhythm.

He stepped onto the loft proper.

The beam under his right foot complained.

He didn’t have time to listen.

He ran the length, palms open, eyes on the lattice of crates and light and dark. The door below was an oblong of fog. He saw the arsonist—just a shape—angling for it. He measured the distance to the ladder drop. He could make it.

The beam snapped.

It didn’t break cleanly. It gave, a knee bending too far, and then let go in segments. The world tilted. Haruto lunged for the crossbeam. He caught it; wood barked his palms. A slat above banged loose and came down. The edge clipped his temple.

A bell rang inside his skull.

He lost the beam, dropped, hit a crate, bounced, and landed on his side with the grace of a dropped net.

Everything flashed white, then black, then too bright.

Noise ran away and came back as static.

His stomach rolled into his throat.

He lay there, breath shallow, rain finally finding him through a break overhead.

The pain didn’t sharpen; it braided.

Then, like someone cracked a hidden door, the world widened.

Lines came into focus that weren’t painted, weren’t etched, weren’t even fully seen. They were suggestions of motion, faint threads pulled taut between positions, pooling probabilities. Haruto’s eyes tracked them without asking his permission. A beam here would drop there, if he stepped here, the crate would tip this way, the arsonist would choose that path because their feet turned in slightly on the left and they wouldn’t risk a slick plank if a dry one existed two steps over.

He blinked.

The lines held.

*No way.*

He lifted his head. It weighed as much as a full barrel. The fuses below hissed a warning. The loft coughed sparks where it had failed him.

Hunger slammed him like a wave.

*I need… five skewers. Ten.*

He rolled, shoved to his knees, then to his feet, legs trembling but obeying. The lines updated as he moved, as if the act of choosing told them what to be. The arsonist’s path threaded the maze toward the fog door, then kinked left—only someone who’d walked this place would know about the half-barrel gap behind the tar drums.

Haruto didn’t chase the figure directly.

He ran to where the line ended.

He cut through a row, hopped a broken pallet, ducked a low tarp that wanted to scalp him, and shouldered through a bead curtain of damp rope. Heat ward glyphs along a crate edge flared to warn him off; he lifted an elbow and let the ward slap cloth, not skin. It stung anyway.

He reached the gap behind the tar drums just as the hooded figure slid for it. They saw him and checked, weight pinning wrong. Haruto didn’t grab. He kicked the tar drum’s base. It rolled with a guttural glug, not far, just enough to make the figure flinch. That flinch turned their body, and their chosen line—so neat, so practiced—stuttered.

Haruto stepped through the open spot the line left behind.

“Stop,” he said, because you were supposed to say it.

The arsonist hissed, more sound than word, and swiped something in his direction. A small sigil popped midair, spat heat, and died against wet wool with a sour smell. They took the second choice the threads had offered, the one that said *if blocked here, cut right, go under*, and dove.

He reached, fingers catching only the edge of their coat. It tore. They slid under a bench, rolled, and were out the door, into fog and rain.

Haruto leaned on the bench and breathed. His head rang. His stomach protested with a hollow ache that felt personal.

Screams outside. Not fear—buckets being ordered and overturned, the particular Greyreach chorus that meant *we know this drill*.

His new awareness didn’t dim. If anything, it hummed, a low engine that kept finding paths and costs.

He should have gone after the arsonist anyway.

He didn’t.

He went into the fire.

---

Inside the maze, the air grew teeth.

The secondary fuse had kissed a stack of treated cloth that burned dirty. Haruto judged the heat and the sag of the tarp by the threads that glowed faintly at the edges of his sight. He kept moving. He needed proof, a something to tell the watch this wasn’t just opportunistic flame.

Heat ward lines on a crate sputtered from orange to tired blue. He skirted. A crate shifted as its lower brace gave. He let it fall, stepping into the space it vacated a heartbeat later, and it crashed behind him rather than on him.

The hum hit him before the sound.

It pulsed low, like a kettle beginning to whistle, like a cat purring into wood.

He stopped.

Under a half-melted tarp—one corner drooling plastic where a transparent ward had pooled heat—something rounded pushed up like a knee through blankets. He lifted the tarp with his coat sleeve, careful of the hottest points.

A smooth shell. Not bird. Bigger. The size of a fat melon. Warm under the soot. Faint glyphs traced across it, baked into the shell itself, not inked—little angular marks that moved only in that way your eyes insisted they had when you looked away.

He put his palm on it.

The hum calmed. Like… it recognized the shape of a hand.

Haruto swallowed. His mouth was dry, which was ridiculous because he’d been rained on for ten minutes.

“Congratulations, Sato,” he muttered. “You stole… breakfast?”

The egg thrummed, offended.

“Okay,” he said immediately. “Not breakfast. Sorry. Mood humor. You’re very not food.”

Another crate groaned like a ship in pain.

He wrapped the egg in his coat as best he could, tucking it high under his arm, close to ribs. The warmth soaked through. The hum steadied, lower now, like whatever was inside had decided he wasn’t trying to scramble it.

He took one last look, fast as a blink, across the immediate floor. The scorch pattern along the nearer wall wasn’t random at all. The marks formed a delicate curve on one side and its mirror on the other, like halves of a quill. The hottest points aligned along that imaginary spine.

He needed that.

He bolted.

---

Rain hit his face like applause.

Docks crowded the world at once. Buckets moving hand to hand. A pair of watchmen arguing about which crate to sacrifice. A scry team arriving with their glass rods like lances, faces already fogged. Someone had cut the echo wire near the blaze so it wouldn’t carry raw heat into the rest of the line. Good. Smart. People didn’t get enough credit during disasters.

“Hey,” a watchman shouted at Haruto. He was young enough to still have hair the rain hadn’t claimed. He took in Haruto’s soot-streaked face, the blood on his temple, and the lump under his coat. “You. F-rank hero! You alive?”

“Currently.”

“You go in there without a hood?” The watchman sounded impressed and offended.

“Door was open.”

“Stay back.” He waved a long arm at Haruto’s chest. “You don’t have wards for this. We’ve got it.”

“I have thirty seconds and my hand,” Haruto said.

He dove toward the nearest stack by the alley mouth, because the feather—no, the feather *shape*—had been there inside, and heat traveled weird in Greyreach warehouses. Rain smeared soot. It made everything a blur. But the pattern had looked etched by fire, not drawn.

He found the crate he wanted by feel more than sight. The surface was black and slick. A delicate thing revealed itself along the top plank and down the side: the curve of a feather vane, the implied barbs on both sides, the quill line rising. Not ink. Heat. The plank’s grain had cooked. Someone had used fire like a stylus.

“Don’t touch that,” a scry tech warned, jogging up with her rod. “Could be unstable.”

“I won’t. I need… one second.” He fumbled for a piece of charcoal. He didn’t carry charcoal. People didn’t carry charcoal around unless they were artists.

He carried pencil stubs in every pocket.

He pulled one free. He had a single folded receipt in his coat—fishmonger IOU on cheap paper. He flattened it shaky and rubbed, fast. The image bloomed. Feather, delicate and arrogant at once. The rain tried to ruin it; he shielded with his body.

The watchman who had yelled earlier stared at the rubbing, then at Haruto’s face. “You people.”

“What people?”

“F-rank heroes,” he said, like it was a species. He jerked his chin at the egg-shaped bulge under Haruto’s coat. “You stealing our breakfast?”

“It’s not—” The egg thumped once against his ribs, a soft, outraged sound. He flinched. “It’s… it’s witness protection.”

The watchman blinked.

Haruto gave him the faintest, least convincing smile he’d ever attempted, then slid sideways into the press of gawkers, using a man with a barrel of eels as cover. He tucked the charcoal rubbing into an inner pocket, away from rain and egg. He didn’t run. Running drew lines from chasers to runner like lanterns drew moths.

He cut through side streets instead.

---

Greyreach possessed ten thousand perfect places to vanish for five minutes and a hundred terrible places to starve.

Haruto picked both.

His vision went wobbly as the threads in his head kept humming, kept mapping, kept feeding him options for exits and trips and bad luck and leverage. He put a palm against a wall to anchor himself. His stomach scolded. The hunger wasn’t normal. It burned clean, like his thoughts were a furnace and somebody had opened the flue.

He checked his wallet out of habit and masochism. One coin. Of course.

The noodle cart auntie at the corner of Ropemaker’s Lane saw him before he saw her. She had a plank set over two barrels and a copper pot steaming, rain kept off by a tarp she’d laced to the alley mouth like she’d been doing this long enough to dislike weather on principle.

She caught the blood at his temple, took the wobble in his step as a personal insult, and snapped her ladle in his direction.

“Sit.”

“I’m—”

“Sit. Or I’ll feed you standing.”

He sat on the little stool. The egg stayed warm under his coat. He kept it tucked, guarded by his arm, line of body casual. The hum vibrated his ribs like a tiny singing bowl.

The auntie slapped a bowl in front of him. Broth. Noodles frothing. Scallions. A slice of pork that had done nothing wrong in its life. The smell reset his bones.

“I have one coin,” Haruto warned.

She reached over, pinched his cheek like he was five years old and dramatic, and said, “You have a tab. Eat first.”

He ate.

The first mouthful hurt from being too hot. The next helped. The third rewired him. The lines in his head steadied, not dimming but aligning. His thoughts stopped scattering into emergency options. His hands stopped shaking.

He inhaled half the bowl and then remembered manners. He slowed before he bit the chopsticks.

Auntie watched with a smugness that only came from being right for twenty years in a row.

“Rough night?” she asked.

“Arson at Nine,” he said. “Weird patterns. And a… uh.” He looked down at his coat like a man looking at a sleeping cat on his chest and wondering how his life got here. “A thing.”

“A girlfriend?” Auntie asked, deadpan.

“Egg,” he said.

She blinked. “You soft-headed boy. You carrying an egg in the rain?”

“It hums when I don’t hold it.”

“That sounds worse.”

He dug awkwardly in his pocket with his free hand and produced the charcoal rubbing. “Payment voucher?”

She took the damp paper, squinted, and sniffed. “You’re paying me with a drawing of a feather.”

“Heat-etched feather.”

“So fancy.” She tucked the paper in her apron like it was a national treasure and shoved a second ladle of noodles into his bowl. “You’ll owe me two bowls tomorrow.”

“I owe you a lot of tomorrows,” he said.

“You do.” She eyed the blood at his temple again. “And no dying on my stools. Bad for business.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

He finished. He put his one coin on the plank.

Auntie put the coin back in his hand. “The tab is a tab.”

He tried to argue with that relentless compassion and lost.

He stood. His legs felt like they belonged to his body again. The lines in the air didn’t vanish, but they tucked themselves into the edges of things, as if satisfied he wasn’t about to walk into a wall.

The egg hummed more softly, like the heat from the broth had reached it through him.

He bowed a little. Auntie swatted the bow like a mosquito. “Go. And if that egg hatches into something with opinions, you bring it by. I have spare opinions.”

“I believe you,” Haruto said.

---

The canal bridge at Hook Street was quiet at this hour. Most gawkers stayed near flame. The drizzle had thinned to the soft kind that turned men’s collars into flags. Barges hunched like sleeping beasts below.

Haruto leaned against the wet rail with his coat closed and the egg tucked in the V of it. The charcoal rubbing lay safe in his inner pocket, warm from his body, for whatever that mattered to paper.

He watched the fog move.

Turning the egg in was the correct process. The watch would catalog it, lock it, argue over jurisdiction with the Guild Consortium’s local branch, and then—if it mattered—it would vanish into a vault until someone who liked forms wrote a form saying it could come back out.

He could picture it: cold shelf, too much silence, hum unanswered. If it even hummed without a hand.

He had rules. Even his rules had rules. But Instructor Shinichi Kanzaki had a rule he’d carved into Haruto’s bones in a dull lecture hall with one window and many yawns.

*Guard what breathes near the truth.*

Haruto was a rookie with a rank they printed on mugs as a joke. He had no authority and less backup. Keeping a piece of evidence was the kind of decision that got you yelled at by five departments. He could hear every version of that lecture already, in many accents.

He pressed his palm to the shell through his coat.

The hum under his hand settled. It wasn’t… grateful. That was ridiculous. But it wasn’t angry either.

“I’ll keep you warm,” he said quietly to something that could not be a conversation partner. “And safe. Until I know who set those fires and why they left you to burn.”

The Evermind Engine—that’s what his head felt like now, an engine—spun a little faster when he said it. Threads of possibility bent toward him and away, showing costs and paths and the way decisions leaned future history. The cost stared back: eat, or this hum would turn to a whine and then to black.

“Fine,” he told his own brain. “We’ll feed you. We’ll feed both of you.”

His stomach, freshly occupied with noodles, had the audacity to agree.

He let his thoughts settle into deliberate calm. He pictured the watch’s likely reports, the scry team’s measurements, how fast the hooded figure could cross Pier Three if they took the east stairs, and where a mirror-scorch ritual would need to be set to make those feather lines bake so cleanly. The lines in his head offered possible bolt-holes and names and debts. He would call Kanzaki in the morning. He would not tell him everything. Not yet.

He pulled the charcoal rubbing out, made sure rain hadn’t smudged it, and slid it back. “Pale quill,” he murmured, the phrase sitting in his mouth like a seed that would be a weed or a tree later.

His breath ghosted in the drizzle.

The egg shifted.

He stilled.

A soft *thump* sounded against his coat, gentle and decisive, like a knuckle on a door.

He pulled the coat open just enough to see shell in the dark. Faint glyphs winked back at him along the curve, like old paint catching a distant cart lamp.

A hairline fracture traced itself along the shell, quick as a drawn breath.

*crk.*

Then it went still.

Haruto stared at it, heartbeat climbing into some new territory where terror and wonder shook hands and lied about being fine.

“Okay,” he whispered, and the fog swallowed the word. “We upgrade the tab to infinity.”

He looked back toward the docks. Whistles. Lanterns. The long good work of people who had showed up once again. Somewhere in that stew of rain and smoke and human noise, a figure in a hood moved and believed they had set a perfect pattern into wood.

Haruto set his jaw.

He kept the egg.

And he went to find who had decided to draw with fire.

# Output from the model Twin
# CHAPTER 1 — Back‑Alley Spark

The thief was a shadow in the rain, but Haruto Sato’s stomach was a roaring beast.

"Thief! My purse!" a fishmonger shrieked, her voice cutting through the hiss of the drizzle and the chaotic bustle of Greyreach’s dockside alleys. The crowd was a clumsy, shifting thing, more obstacle than help. Oily water sloshed over slick cobblestones, reflecting the dim glow of scry glass lanterns.

Haruto’s goal was simple: get the purse, get the reward, get a grilled squid skewer. Preferably two. His stomach growled in furious agreement.

The thief, a lanky figure in a soaked cloak, moved with a slippery grace. He vaulted a low-railing, landing on the narrow lip of the canal that snaked through the district. A pack of alley dogs, startled by the commotion, yapped at his heels, their paws scrabbling on the wet stone. It was a good escape route—no one sane would follow him onto that treacherous path.

*Idiot,* Haruto thought, his eyes narrowing. *You’re running in a pattern.* He didn’t see it as a line, but as a rhythm. *Left foot heavy, right foot light. Hops every third step to clear the loose stones.* While the crowd surged toward the canal, Haruto melted into a side passage, his worn boots silent. The cadence of the thief’s flight was a drumbeat in his head, a map of future steps.

He emerged from the darkness just as the thief slid off the canal wall, thinking he was clear. Haruto didn’t throw a punch. He just stuck out his foot.

The thief went down in a clatter of flailing limbs and a splash that sent a wave of fish-scented water across the alley. The purse, a small leather pouch, skidded to a halt by Haruto’s boot.

He picked it up, turned, and handed it to the breathless fishmonger. “Here you go, ma’am.”

She snatched it back, checked the contents, and gave him a grudging nod. “My hero,” she said, then rummaged in her stall. She held out a single, slightly charred squid skewer. “The hero discount.”

Haruto’s eye twitched. “So… free?”

“The discount is that I’m *giving* it to you,” she huffed, before turning to curse the thief, who was now being surrounded by two burly dockhands.

His stomach rumbled again, a low, mournful sound. One skewer. He’d have to make it last.

---

Just as he was about to take his first, glorious bite, the echo wire bells of the central watchtower began to toll. It wasn’t the rhythmic chime for the hour, but a frantic, clanging alarm. *Fire.*

He looked up. Oily black smoke was billowing into the drizzly sky from the warehouse district, staining the clouds a sickly grey. That was Warehouse 7, one of the Kaito Guild’s storage depots. Full of imported textiles, dry lumber, and probably a fortune in rune-etched shipping crates.

*Forget the skewer.* Adrenaline was a meal of its own. He had to scout it before the Watch cordoned everything off. F-rank rookies like him didn’t get assigned to major incidents; they got to read the boring reports later. But a good witness report, filed early? That was worth coin. Maybe even three skewers.

He sprinted toward the blaze, the skewer clutched in his hand like a talisman. The heat hit him a block away, a dry, oppressive wave. The warehouse wasn't just on fire; it was an inferno. Crates formed a smoldering maze around the main building. As he navigated the labyrinth, a hooded figure darted from behind a stack of barrels. The figure knelt, a flicker of light in their hand, and touched it to a long, thin fuse that snaked toward a *second* warehouse.

Haruto froze. This wasn't an accident. This was arson.

He saw the scorch marks on the ground around the second fuse. They weren’t random blast patterns; they were symmetrical, almost artistic. A mirror image of the patterns he could now see near the first burning building. *A ritual,* he realized. *Not a robbery.*

His rune phone, a clunky brass-and-glass device, was already in his hand. He pressed the emergency glyph. “Haruto Sato, F-rank. Arson in progress at Kaito warehouses, Dock 7. Second fire being set now. I’m in pursuit.”

The dispatcher’s tinny voice crackled back, but Haruto was already moving. He shoved the squid skewer into his pocket and gave chase.

---

Inside the main warehouse was like a descent into the sun. The air was thick with smoke and the sharp, popping sound of activating sigils as crates of enchanted goods cooked off. Beams overhead groaned under the strain, their support structures glowing cherry-red.

The arsonist was heading for a loft on the far side, a clear path to the roof and escape. Haruto saw a shortcut: a series of stacked, heavy-duty crates leading up to the same loft. He could cut the figure off.

He scrambled up the first crate, heat searing through the soles of his boots. The arsonist glanced back, a flash of white mask under their hood, then moved faster. Haruto pushed himself, leaping from one crate to the next. He was almost there when a deafening *CRACK* split the air.

A support beam, eaten through by the fire, snapped. It swung down like the arm of a god. Haruto tried to dodge, but he wasn’t fast enough. The end of the beam clipped him squarely on the side of the head.

Pain exploded behind his eyes, a white-hot nova. His skull rang like a struck bell. He tumbled from the crates, landing hard on the soot-covered floor.

But then, something shifted.

The blinding pain didn’t fade. It *focused*. The world, once a blurry mess of heat and smoke, sharpened to an impossible clarity. The random dance of falling embers was no longer random; he could see the tiny air currents guiding them. The groaning of the dying building wasn't just noise; it was a symphony of stress points, each one a note predicting the next collapse.

He looked toward the arsonist, and the world changed. Faint, shimmering lines of pale blue light threaded through the air, tracing the paths the figure was most likely to take. One line led to a collapsing section of the floor. Another led directly into the path of a falling stack of shelves. A third, the brightest, snaked through a small, almost invisible gap in the fire toward a reinforced loading door.

*The Evermind Engine.* He remembered the stories his grandfather used to tell, about a rare, forbidden elixir called the Quiet Spark. A single drop was supposed to awaken the mind's true potential. His parents had dismissed it as a fairy tale. But a memory surfaced—a clumsy, six-year-old Haruto, a fall from a tree, a strange, sweet liquid being pressed to his lips by his frantic mother.

The clarity came with a cost. A wave of dizziness washed over him, followed by a sudden, ravenous hunger that dwarfed anything he’d felt before. It was a physical ache, a desperate craving for fuel. *I need… five more skewers. Ten. A whole damn cart.*

His body screamed in protest, but his mind was serene. The arsonist, oblivious, took the path of the brightest thread. Haruto, instead of following, rolled away, just as the shelves the second thread had predicted came crashing down where he’d been lying. He lived because his mind had already seen him die.

---

The arsonist slammed the loading door shut and vanished into the fog and drizzle outside. The brief lull was surreal. The fire roared, a beast devouring everything, but the immediate chase was over. Haruto knew he had seconds before the Watch’s heat wards activated, sealing the area. He needed proof.

He scanned the scene, his new perception filtering the chaos. Most of the evidence was ash. But under a half-melted, smoldering tarp, something pulsed with a faint, internal light. It wasn’t on fire. In fact, the flames seemed to curve around it.

He scrambled over, ignoring the searing heat, and kicked the tarp away. Nestled in a bed of grey ash was an egg. It was about the size of two fists, with a shell like polished obsidian, warm and smooth to the touch. It hummed with a low, steady vibration, a calming thrum that seemed to push back against the fire’s rage. Faint, silvery glyphs swirled just beneath its surface, patterns he’d never seen before.

Without thinking, he scooped it up. It was heavier than it looked. He tore off a piece of his worn coat and wrapped the egg carefully. The moment his skin made contact, the humming intensified for a second, a note of… recognition? Then it settled, content.

*“Congratulations, Sato,”* he muttered to himself, his voice raspy from the smoke. *“You chased an arsonist and stole… breakfast?”*

The egg pulsed once, a short, sharp thrum of what felt suspiciously like offense. Haruto stared at it, then whispered, “Sorry.”

---

He slipped out a side exit just as the loud clang of the Watch’s containment wards slammed into place. Whistles echoed through the docks as the first responders began to organize. He needed to be gone.

But first, the symbol. The symmetrical scorch marks. He retraced his steps to where the arsonist had lit the second fuse. Rain was beginning to smear the soot, washing away the evidence. Visibility was low, the air thick with smoke and mist.

There, on the side of a charred crate, was the mark. It wasn’t painted or drawn. It was etched by the heat itself, a delicate, intricate feather. The scorch pattern was so precise it looked like a brand. It was the source of the symmetry.

He fumbled in his pouch, pulling out a nub of charcoal and a scrap of parchment from his investigator’s kit. With quick, practiced strokes, he made a rubbing of the feather mark. He tucked the rubbing into an inner pocket, right next to the warm, humming weight of the egg. The Pale Quill. A name formed in his mind, unbidden.

---

The walk away from the docks was a blur. His head throbbed, not from the blow, but from the Engine’s relentless demand for fuel. The threads of probability were still visible, shimmering over the heads of gawkers and the movements of the Watch patrols, guiding him through the side streets. But they were fraying, growing dim.

He checked his wallet. Tragedy. One coin left. Not even enough for a bowl of plain noodles. The Engine was going to stall, and he worried what would happen if it did. Would the clarity vanish? Would the pain return?

He stumbled toward the scent of broth and found a small noodle cart tucked into an alcove, its lantern a beacon of hope. The auntie running it, a woman with a kind, wrinkled face, took one look at the drying blood on his temple and the soot on his clothes.

“You look like you wrestled a fire elemental and lost,” she said, her voice stern but her eyes soft. She didn’t wait for an answer. A moment later, a steaming bowl of pork noodles was thrust into his hands. “On my tab. Eat.”

He tried to protest, to offer his last coin, but she just waved him off. Haruto didn’t argue. He inhaled the noodles in five massive gulps. The effect was immediate. The world snapped back into focus. The hunger pangs receded to a dull ache. The shimmering threads brightened, re-aligning themselves into coherent patterns.

He looked at the empty bowl. The Engine ran hot. His body was the furnace, and food was the coal. This was going to be expensive.

---

Haruto stood on a quiet rope bridge overlooking a darkened canal, far from the chaos of the docks. The egg, nestled inside his coat against his chest, hummed like a tiny, contented kettle. The city watch would be looking for any evidence. The egg was evidence. It was probably priceless. Turning it in was the proper procedure. It would be cataloged, stored in an evidence vault, and likely never seen again.

But it was also… alive. It had reacted to him. It felt like a witness, not an object.

He remembered a line from his old instructor at the academy, the brilliant and perpetually lazy Shinichi Kanzaki. *“Guard what breathes near the truth, Sato. Documents can be forged, but a living thing carries the honest story in its pulse.”*

Keeping it was a risk. A huge one. The Kaito Guild would want it. The Watch would want it. Whoever left it there might come back for it.

He felt the charcoal rubbing in his pocket. The feather. The egg. They were connected. This wasn't just arson. It was a message. And he was the only one who had received both parts of it.

He made his choice. He would keep the egg. He would find the person with the feather mark.

As if sealing his vow, the egg in his coat gave a sudden, sharp thump.

*Crk.*

A hairline fracture appeared on the smooth, dark shell, a tiny line of light in the darkness. Then, it went still and silent.

# CHAPTER 1 — Back-Alley Spark

The fishmonger's voice cut through the drizzle like a rusty knife. "Thief! Someone grab him!"

Haruto Sato pressed his back against the canal wall, watching the crowd scatter like startled pigeons. A hooded figure burst from the chaos, clutching a leather purse to their chest. The thief vaulted over a stack of crates, sending dried squid flying into the rain-slick alley.

*Perfect timing.* Haruto's stomach growled, loud enough to echo off the stone. *I was just thinking about dinner.*

The thief sprinted toward the canal rail. Standard escape route—leap the water, lose pursuit in the maze of rope bridges beyond. Haruto pushed off the wall, reading the runner's gait. Left foot dragged slightly. Favoring an old injury.

He didn't chase. He cut left instead, sliding between two vendor stalls.

The alley dogs started barking—three mutts that always lounged near the dumpling cart. The thief stumbled, trying to dodge their snapping jaws. That half-second hesitation was all Haruto needed.

He emerged from the side passage just as the thief recovered their stride. One quick sweep of his leg sent them tumbling into a pile of empty fishing nets.

"Evening." Haruto plucked the purse from the thief's grip. The runner scrambled up and bolted without a word, vanishing into the dock mist. "You're welcome for not calling the watch."

The fishmonger wheezed up behind him, red-faced and panting. "My purse! You—you actually got it!"

"Lucky timing." Haruto handed it over, trying not to stare at the meat skewers hanging from the nearby stall. The vendor noticed his gaze.

"Hero discount for you!" The vendor grinned, holding out a single lonely skewer. "On the house!"

Haruto stared at the solitary piece of grilled meat. "The hero discount is... one skewer?"

"Times are tough." The vendor's grin widened. "But hey, you're a hero now!"

His stomach protested again, louder this time. *One skewer. I save a man's wages and get one—*

The bell tower's bronze voice shattered his thoughts. Three long tolls, two short. Fire warning from the dock district.

Smoke was already rising, thick and black against the evening drizzle.

***

The warehouse burned wrong. 

Haruto crouched behind a stack of cargo, studying the flames through the rain. Fire didn't usually form perfect circles on wooden walls. Those scorch patterns—symmetrical, deliberate. This wasn't some drunk knocking over a lantern.

A hooded figure emerged from a side door, carrying something that glowed faintly blue. They knelt by another warehouse and pressed the object against the wall. Fresh flames erupted instantly.

"Not random at all." Haruto pulled out his rune phone, speaking the activation word. The crystal flickered to life for exactly thirty seconds—all the charge he could afford. "Dock fire, intentional arson. Second building now burning. Send the watch."

The crystal died before he got confirmation. Typical.

The arsonist was already moving toward a third target. Haruto couldn't wait for backup. He sprinted across the dock, angling to cut them off. The warehouse interior would be faster than going around—if he could handle the heat.

He burst through the loading door. 

The heat hit like a physical wall. Crates formed a maze, some already burning, others just starting to smoke. Above, support beams groaned under the assault of flame. The loft level offered a straight path to the far exit.

Haruto took the stairs three at a time.

The wooden walkway shuddered under his boots. Below, something exploded—probably paint or lamp oil. The arsonist would exit through the north door in about fifteen seconds, maybe twenty if they were careful.

He could make it in ten if he ran.

The beam snapped without warning.

Wood cracked against his skull, sending him sprawling across the walkway. The world went white, then black, then—

Sharp.

Everything became impossibly sharp. 

Lines of probability threaded through the air like spider silk. He could see the path the next falling beam would take. The trajectory of sparks from the burning crates. The exact spot where the walkway would collapse in six seconds.

*Five seconds.*

He rolled left. The walkway crumbled where he'd been lying.

*What is this?*

His mind raced, but not in the normal way. It was like someone had lit a forge inside his skull. Thoughts became molten metal, flowing into new shapes faster than he could track. He could feel branches of possibility spreading from each potential action.

The north door—the arsonist would exit in three seconds. Turn left toward the canal. Hop the low fence. Duck into the third alley.

Haruto's body moved before he finished thinking. He swung down from what remained of the walkway, landing hard but rolling with the impact. His legs drove him forward, following a path that existed only in his mind.

He burst from the warehouse just as the hooded figure reached the fence.

They locked eyes for a heartbeat. The arsonist's hand went to their belt—a knife? A rune?—but then they vaulted the fence and vanished into the fog.

Haruto started to follow, then stopped. His body felt wrong. Hollow. Like someone had scooped out his insides and replaced them with hunger.

*I need food. Now. Five skewers. No, ten. Maybe twenty.*

The sensation was so intense he nearly collapsed. His enhanced awareness flickered, the threads of probability fading in and out like a dying lantern.

*Later. Evidence first.*

He turned back to the burning warehouse. Most of it was already consumed, but there—under a section of tin roofing that had fallen and created a pocket of protection—something glowed.

Not with fire. Something else.

Haruto wrapped his coat around his hand and lifted the metal sheet. Underneath sat an egg the size of his fist, warm to the touch even through the fabric. Faint glyphs covered its shell, etched in patterns that hurt to look at directly.

The egg hummed. Actually hummed, like a kettle about to boil.

"What were you doing in a warehouse?" He lifted it carefully. The humming intensified for a moment, then calmed when his skin made contact with the shell. "That's... weird."

"Nice work, hero!" A voice called out. One of the dock workers, grinning despite the chaos. "What'd you save from the fire?"

Haruto looked down at the egg in his hands. "Breakfast?"

The egg's humming took on an offended tone.

"Sorry," he muttered to it, feeling ridiculous. "Not breakfast. Definitely not breakfast."

***

The rain had picked up, washing soot from the air but making visibility worse. Haruto circled the burned warehouses, looking for anything the arsonist might have left behind.

There—on a charred crate that had somehow survived mostly intact. A mark in the wood, delicate as frost on glass. A feather, etched by heat rather than carved. The edges were too perfect to be accidental.

He pulled out a piece of charcoal from the ruins and a scrap of paper from his pocket. Quick strokes captured the design before rain could wash it away. The feather was elegant, almost artistic. Definitely a signature of some kind.

Watch whistles sounded from three directions. Time to go.

***

The noodle cart auntie took one look at him and shoved a bowl into his hands.

"I can't—" Haruto fumbled for his wallet. One coin left. Not even enough for the small portion.

"Tab." She pointed at the blood trickling from his temple. "You eat now, pay later. Sit."

He didn't argue. Couldn't, really. The hunger had become a living thing, clawing at his insides. He wolfed down the noodles so fast he barely tasted them. The fog in his mind cleared slightly. The threads of probability solidified, becoming useful instead of overwhelming.

"More?" The auntie was already ladling a second portion.

"I..." His pride warred with his stomach. His stomach won. "Please."

She smiled and filled the bowl to the brim. "Growing boy. You need strength for whatever trouble you're in."

*If only she knew.*

The egg in his coat pocket hummed contentedly, warm against his ribs.

***

Haruto found himself on a quiet canal bridge, rain pattering on the wooden planks. The egg sat in his palm, still humming that strange, almost musical tone. Like a lullaby sung by something that had never heard a human voice.

He should turn it in. Whatever this thing was, it was evidence. The watch would want it. The investigators would catalog it, tag it, lock it in some vault where it would gather dust while forms were filed in triplicate.

The egg pulsed with warmth. Alive. Definitely alive.

He thought of his old instructor, Shinichi Kanzaki. The man had a saying: "Guard what breathes near the truth." 

The egg was breathing, in its own way. And it had been at the center of whatever the arsonist was doing. That made it important. Too important to lose in bureaucratic nowhere.

"Alright." Haruto tucked the egg back into his coat along with the charcoal rubbing of the feather. "You're with me now. We'll figure out what you are and why someone wanted you burned."

The egg thumped once against his ribs.

Then—*crack*.

A hairline fracture appeared across the shell's surface, glowing faintly from within.

The humming stopped.

Haruto held his breath, waiting. The egg was still warm, still obviously alive, but something had changed. Something was beginning.

He thought about the arsonist's eyes in that brief moment of contact. Cold. Calculating. They'd be back. Whatever they'd been trying to destroy—or steal—they hadn't finished the job.

The threads in his mind aligned, showing him glimpses of possibility. Investigation. Conflict. Growth. The Evermind Engine hummed in his skull, hungry for more data, more fuel, more everything.

His stomach growled in agreement.

"Tomorrow," he told the egg. "Tomorrow we start hunting."

The city lights blurred through the rain. Somewhere out there, the arsonist was probably reporting failure. Somewhere else, the watch was cataloging damage and writing reports that would lead nowhere.

But here on this bridge, a failed F-rank investigator held a cracking dragon egg and the first piece of a puzzle that would reshape everything.

The feather mark. The Pale Quill.

He didn't know the name yet. Didn't know what he'd stumbled into.

But his instincts—sharpened now by the Engine—whispered that this was just the beginning.

The egg pulsed once more, and another crack appeared.

Soon.
