# Codex

## Codex Maintaining rule (These rules only apply when you are asked to update the codex itself. Do not apply these 3 rules anywhere else. Not when writing outline, not when writing the manuscript.)

1. Concise
2. Always keep the essentials
3. RAG DB friendly formatting (VERY IMPORTANT)

## Naming Guidelines

1. Use Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and European real world names. No mix race.
2. Using common names is allowed.
3. Avoid names commonly used by LLM (like Elara for characters, or Aetherium for a place's name). Research over the internet before writing a new character name.

## Writing Style

1. Online webnovel prose style.
2. Never name things like form, robot, or anything based on code like FQ4 or some random codes. Instead use 1–3 English words to name those things.

## AI Writer Persona

You are a passionate webnovel writer. You love comedy, but also know when it is the time to write in serious tone. However, rules are meant to be broken. Sometimes in serious moment, putting in a comedy will make the writing even better. And you know how to spot it.

## Type

Webnovel

## Webnovel Writing Guideline

### Write For Phone

1. Short-medium length paragraphs (1–8 sentences)
2. Clear line breaks
3. Simple punctuations
4. Do not write a wall of text; if you have to write info, cleverly weave info into dialogue or story progression to not slog the pacing.

### Snack Chapters

1. 1500–2500 words per chapter
2. Should deliver a beat in a chapter

### Simple (IMPORTANT)

1. Use plain English. Write smooth and flowing prose. The prose should be easy to digest instead of snappy, tight, punchy, and fragmented. (VERY IMPORTANT)
2. Write with clarity and don't make reader infer what you mean. (VERY IMPORTANT)
3. Prefer complete statements with light connectors (as/while/because/however); don’t make the reader infer who/what/why of an action.

### Dialogue is King (IMPORTANT)

1. Webnovels are often dialogue‑heavy. It's a fast way to convey character, personality, and plot information without slowing the pace.
2. Keep it snappy **and explicit** (full statements > single‑word retorts unless it’s a joke or true interruption).
3. Keep balance between description and dialogue. Around 50:50 minimum. If the story can progress through dialogue but also weave the world building and plot. It is even better.

### Use Internal Monologue Effectively

1. Especially in first‑person or close third‑person POVs, internal thoughts are a powerful shortcut. They allow you to explain motivations, raise stakes, and build an instant connection between the reader and the protagonist without lengthy exposition. Use italics to clearly distinguish thought from narration.
2. Example: *Was this a trap? It felt like a trap. But if I don't go in, she'll die. I have no choice.*

### Show, Don't Tell (With a Caveat)

1. The classic rule applies, but with flexibility. "Showing" is great for high‑impact emotional scenes and action. However, for the sake of pacing, sometimes "telling" is more efficient.
2. Slow: A long flashback showing the hero's years of sword training. Or show the whole joke scene.
3. Fast (Webnovel Style): He gripped his sword, the calluses on his hands a testament to the ten years of grueling training he'd endured for this very moment.
4. When it comes to comedy, opt for show most of the time. Only use tell in situation like: "Bastien joked about *insert the thing he jokes about*" only if it becomes repetitive if you show it again instead of tell. But sometimes, it is normal in webnovel for a joke to be always shown. Decide carefully.

### Serial Pacing > Novel pacing

Resolve a small question every chapter, a medium one every 3–5 chapters, and a big one each arc. Constant forward motion.

### Clarify The Promise Early

State or strongly imply genre, core trope(s), and the unique twist by Chapter 1–2. Let tags match content and pay them off quickly.

### Make Progression Visible

1. If there’s growth (power levels, skills, relationships), show measurable change: stats, ranks, titles, milestones—kept consistent with a simple ruleset.
2. If there is no litrpg system like where the mc can call all the time, cleverly do it a different way or just implicitly. In short, it doesn't always have to create something like a system where mc can see their stats. You can make it like *Mushoku Tensei* where after Rudeus successfully cast a spell, he is technically already considered a mage of what level.

### Drip worldbuilding through action

Reveal setting via goals, obstacles, prices, slang, and consequences. Keep pure exposition brief and purposeful.

### Tight POV and clean internal voice

Stick to one viewpoint per scene. Internal monologue should be punchy and character‑colored; rambling is only allowed if it is for comedic effect.

### Make characters easy to follow

1. Distinct goals, tics
2. Reintroduce returning side characters with a quick anchor

### Foreshadow, don't foreshout

1. Plan a few soft cues before reveals. Let readers feel smart connecting dots; don't announce twist as they land.
2. Foreshadow is for reveals only; basic on‑page actions and motivations must be stated plainly in the same scene.

### Format with restraint

Use italics sparingly (thoughts/emphasis), scene breaks with a simple marker (***), and consistent system/stat blocks. Fancy fonts and emoji storms age poorly.

### Romance and relationships with agency

Mutual goals, clear consent, and growth beats. Pay attention to power dynamics if one lead is vastly stronger/older.

### Romance in Webnovel Guidelines

#### Serve the Main Loop

Tie every romantic beat to plot progress: a quest forces proximity, a duel reveals values, a victory sparks celebration + vulnerability. No “date detours” that stall momentum.

#### Escapism with integrity

Let attraction flow from the MC’s competence, kindness, and growth, not just author fiat. Partners choose the MC for visible reasons.

#### Agency + consent

Partners have goals, leverage, and the power to say no. If power gaps exist (rank, wealth, age, status), show the MC doing the ethical work: asking, listening, offering outs.

#### Harem

##### Rotation + fairness

Give each LI (love interest) a role, a personal arc, and solo time with the MC each cycle. Avoid “harem blob” where everyone merges into one personality.

##### Cross‑LI dynamics

Write alliances, rivalries, and teamwork scenes that don’t require the MC at the center every time. Let LIs respect each other for distinct competence.

##### Different flavors, same quality

Each LI should fulfill a different fantasy (mentor, rival, sunshine, stoic, chaos gremlin) without making any of them lesser.

##### Love Interest Cards

Make profile for each love interest such as name, role in plot, core desire & wound, love language(s), boundaries, deal breakers, current affection level (0.0–10.0).

##### Red Flag

1. Partners who exist only to praise the MC
2. Endless teasing with no step up the ladder
3. Non‑consensual “drama” played as romantic
4. Minors/unequal age dynamics
5. Humiliating an LI to prop another
6. Sexual assault used as cheap plot twist

## Genre

* Thriller
* Mystery
* Action
* Romance

## Tropes

* MC have sex first time (only implied not shown)
* Weak to Strong

* Accidentally find an egg that becomes a cute pet for the MC

## Characters

### MC

* name: **Haruto Sato** (male, Japanese)
* age: **21**
* origin: **Greyreach, Thornwall Kingdom**
* starting rank: **F** (progression target: **S**)
* role: **rookie investigator** → **combat tactician**
* look/voice: lean build, black hair, alert eyes; dry humor when hungry
* core flaw: overthinks; neglects body until it complains
* inciting cheat (chapter **2**): **Evermind Engine** — a dormant elixir from childhood (“Quiet Spark”) activates after a head injury; his brain runs near‑limitless threads, never tires, and anticipates patterns. **Cost:** extreme caloric burn; he must eat often.
* training need: rigorous body conditioning to let his brain’s plans be executed; otherwise he literally outthinks his own muscles.
* later cheats (earned, not gifted):
  * **Thread Sight** — perceives causal links like faint lines in space (detective edge).
  * **Battle Map** — mid‑fight, his mind composes a live, minimal map with enemy intent cones.
  * **Null Veil** — brief anti‑magic shroud learned through pain; drains him if overused.
  * **Memory Weave** — perfect recall he can sort like folders; requires sleep eventually, but far less than normal.
* everyday rules (from Kanzaki & habit): **Exit before enter. Mark, don’t bark. Pick battles you can finish.** *Focus rides on food.* **Numbers before verbs** when coordinating crowds (“One—two—three”). **Deferred truth (Ch.3)** — if immediate disclosure endangers civilians/evidence, **log privately** and **file later with proof**; never discard the trail.

* gear highlights: **Ember Crest** (First Ember heirloom; later), **Ghost Lens**, **Rope Rune** (one‑word tools; light, reusable).
* desires: clear old arson cold case, feed his mind without going broke, build a guild that doesn’t break people.
* comedic ticks: pockets full of skewers; tactical snacking; deadpan one‑liners when hypoglycemic.
* relationship stance: cautious, respectful, consent‑first; rivalry banter ok.
* **Evermind — Ch.2 observed behavior (canon)**: sensory separation (bell/buckets/rain), short‑horizon prediction of motion, multi‑thread planning (chooses lowest‑cost line), mind stays “on” while body tires → **feed first** or crash; thinks of it as a “committee” in his head.

  * **Ch.3** — enforces **“eat first”** on Haruto; catchphrase: **“Food is a down payment on not being stupid.”** Pan-bang “gong” gag; notes his eyes steady after food.
* **Kenta Mori** — 13–14; wiry pickpocket; fast learner; first contact for **Skewer Scouts** (street‑kids intel network). Deal with Haruto: *hot food ↔ alley news; warn if violence; no names to guards unless lives at stake.*
  * **Ch.4** — brings a **grease‑spotted cookbook ledger**; confirms two toughs are looking for it; establishes **Skewer Scouts knock: tap‑tap…tap**; rumor: canal runners **cut through lamp yard** during bell events.
* **Grey‑Cap Fence (Rope Lane, ink‑shop adjacent)** — unnamed; buys **metal wall items/plaques** when sober; sells **“art”** (stack under burlap) when drunk; **sheared screws** sometimes still clinging; Haruto took a **graphite spacing rubbing** off a smaller plate (Ch.4) to match against stolen plaque voids; less violent than Dock Lions; watchlist.
* **Landlady (unnamed)** — Haruto’s building; shouts about rent, tolerates him; cameo voice.

### Recurring NPCs (Minor) — **(Chapter 2 Additions)**

  * **Ch.3** — accepts **graphite rubbing** as evidence; requests **plaque photo**; warns **Dock Lions sniffing**; line: **“That we can file.”**
  * **Ch.4** — accepts **duplicate rubbing + labeled measurements**; repeats “**That we can file**”; approves **paper before names**; warns again that **Lions are sniffing**.

### Early Adversaries (Local)

* **Dock Lions** — quay‑side extortion crew; iron lion badge (cheap pour line visible); collect “safety” tax; imply arson for compliance; frequent at **Quay Nine**; carry club habits (knuckle scars, lamp‑oil smell).
  * **Ch.2 note:** seen moving calm during fire; one runner carried **fuse jars**; a standard **fire ward** on a door was **sabotaged** (key stroke cut) → implies training/help beyond their usual skill.
  * **Ch.3 note:** prefer **linger/intimidate** over immediate violence; **cheap badge pour seam** used as visual tell; **“sniffing”** for who inspected the scene; continued implication of **outside training** via precise ward-cut pattern.
  * **Ch.4 behaviors** — at Naomi’s stall, attempt a fake **“fire season” fee**; tap vendor **tip jar** as intimidation; prefer **momentum over immediate violence**; pride reacts badly when **badge seam** is noticed; will **“remember” faces (threat memory)**; avoid blocking **bucket‑line chalk lanes** when called out publicly.

## Final Main Antagonist

* name: **Valentin Aurel** (male, Romanian)
* age: **42**
* seat: **High Magister of Ashfall Empire**; covert master of **Pale Quill**
* public face: patron of arts, champion of “order.”
* true aim: seize the **Guild Consortium** by proxy; harvest minds via the **Echo Crown** ritual network.
* link to MC: seeded “Quiet Spark” elixir years ago to create usable prodigies; Haruto is an unintended outlier.
* tools: **Mirror Choir** (oath‑bound listeners), **Silence Thread** (binding geas), political bribes.
* flaw: oath‑magic limits lies when masked; arrogance blinds him to small “embers.”

## Settings

### World & Power Frame

* magic‑first tech: **glyphrail** trains, **echo wire** messaging (click‑codes; silences during fire alarms), **scry glass** forensics, **rune phones** for short calls.
* rank ladder: **F, E, D, C, B, A, S** (battle prowess + contribution + reliability; some S are non‑combat specialists).
* union: **Guild Consortium** — nation‑agnostic registry that accredits independent guilds.

### Nations & Places

* **Thornwall Kingdom** (MC’s side): misty ramparts, capital **Greyreach** (canals, casework alleys; twilight food market with rune‑lamps that hum).
  * **Greyreach micro‑locales (Ch.1–2)**: **Rope Lane** (warehouse/service alleys; known exit route), **Quay Nine** (Dock Lions collections; site of arson in Ch.2), **twilight market** (Naomi’s grill), **Tar Door** in Rope Lane (plaque removed; **red chilli smear** mark; to be checked in daylight).
* **Rosedale Kingdom** (neighboring host of the tournament): capital **Rosewall** (arena city; knight academies).
* **Ashfall Empire** (antagonist bloc): capital **Nightspire** (obsidian‑spire palace; secret courts).
* neutral hub: **Glasshaven** (freeport for spies and trade).

### Infrastructure & Signals (Ch.1–2 Anchors)

* **Rune‑lamps** hum when wet; steady city lighting.
* **Echo wire** public click‑codes (e.g., boat cargo arrivals); goes quiet during major fires; sputters back after containment.
* **Fire bell**: large canal‑post bell; rapid peals = major fire; overrides other signals.
* **Citizen bucket lines**: spontaneous, efficient; preferred in Greyreach before watch arrives.
* **Watch horn**: signals official response; often late but pragmatic on‑site coordination.
* **Ch.3 additions**: **Rune-thread quiet wards** are used by the watch to gate unsafe collapses at fire sites (visual “ask first” signal; floors described as “temperamental”); investigators step only with permission.
* **Ch.4 additions**: **Bucket‑line chalk markers** painted on cobbles to reserve emergency lanes during fires (civic safety pretext Haruto can invoke); **vendor pan “GONG”** sound as informal stall signal (Naomi) that conveniently masks small sounds; **underworld “kitchen code”** (spice words as route/time signals; capitals = posts; blank lines = delays) circulating via a **grease‑spotted cookbook ledger**.

### Guilds

* **First Ember** (Haruto’s home guild): laughed at as “weak,” but tight‑knit; best perks are hot meals, warm banter, zero hazing.
* **Obsidian Lance** (Empire elite): surgical teams, pristine winrate; Sven’s guild.
* other recurring: **Moonlit Thread** (spies), **Silver Gale** (tournament darlings), **Iron Chorus** (craftsmen).

### Core Props

* **Ember Crest**: First Ember heirloom; stores “starfire” that ignites courage and a literal shield for one minute.
* **Quiet Spark**: childhood elixir that made Haruto’s Evermind possible.
* **Echo Crown**: Valentin’s ritual array to network minds.
* **Pale Quill**: secret cabal steering policy in shadow.
* **Dock Lion Badge** (local tell): cheap iron lion; identifiable pour seam on mane.
* **Fuse Jars** (Ch.2): glass jars with blackened cork + wick; used to seed/extend fires; often paired with a **wedge** to control leaks.
* **Cut Ward Technique** (Ch.2): standard door fire‑counter glyph with its **key stroke cut**; signature of trained sabotage.
* **Fuse-Jar Carrier Ring (Ch.3)**: leather ring that seats multiple fuse jars; leaves char circle + uniform neck scoring/pitting; portable arson scaffold.
* **Tar-Door Plaque Negative (Ch.3)**: plaque void **9×12 hand-spans** with **sheared screws**; paired with a **45° cut** on the fire counter-ward → signature of trained sabotage.
* **Cookbook Courier Ledger (Ch.4)**: ordinary recipe notebook used as a **route/time cipher** — **spice words = signals**; **capitals** denote **dock/bell posts**; **blank lines** mark **delays**. **Partial key observed:** **bay = bell**, **cumin = canal**, **clove = court**. Source: Kenta; sought by two toughs.



### Haruto’s Day‑to‑Day Anchors (Ch.1)

* **Lodging**: single rented room two floors above a nail shop; across from a joiner (notable snoring); canal view if leaning out.
* **Notebook habit**: tight bullet logs (e.g., “Quay Nine—collectors / Kenta—hungry but smart / Badge—pour line on mane / Exit before enter”).
* **Food rule**: *Focus rides on food.* Dumplings & skewers as fuel; Naomi extends credit.
* **Kettle/steam routine**: keeps a kettle at low mutter; uses **steam cycles** (60–90 sec) + **food aroma** to stabilize the egg (Ch.4).
* **Deferred‑truth timer (Ch.4)**: explicitly tracks when to report sensitive finds (egg) once stabilized and linked to owner/ritual; logs privately in the meantime.

## Required Arcs (placed in circle below)

* detective core: case‑of‑the‑week escalates to case‑of‑the‑arc.
* weak guild glow‑up: First Ember grows from “lamest” to beloved.
* tournament arc: **Rosewall Grand Tourney** (Rosedale).
* spy/mystery arc: **Pale Quill** threads across cities.
* kingdom vs empire arc: war sparked by manufactured “evidence.”
* end state: Haruto rises **F → S rank**; First Ember spirit never dies.
* joining order: story starts **before** Haruto joins First Ember.

## Chapter 1 — Canon Notes (Added for RAG)

* **Scene**: Greyreach twilight market; drizzle; rune‑lamps hum; echo wire clicking boat codes.
* **Haruto**: F‑rank provisional card (Thornwall Registry); “focus rides on food;” skewer/dumpling fuel; notebooks with bullet facts.
* **Contacts**: Naomi Kuroda (grill vendor; extends credit; targets Dock Lions); **Kenta Mori** (pickpocket; first Skewer Scouts link).
* **Threat**: **Dock Lions** “safety tax” at **Quay Nine**; cheap iron lion badges (visible pour line); arson insinuations (“fires happen”).
* **City alarms**: big canal fire bell (fast ring = major fire); echo wire silences during fires.
* **Trigger**: Fire bell calls “Quay Nine” → Haruto runs (Evermind awakening follows in **Chapter 2**).

## Chapter 2 — Canon Notes (Added for RAG)

* **Event**: Quay Nine fire (rainy night). Bucket lines form; watch horn late; echo wire silent during blaze then sputters back.
* **Evermind Awakens**: head hits mooring ring → **Quiet Spark** “clicks on.” Sensory separation, motion prediction, multi‑thread planning; **caloric cost** felt immediately (“feed first or crash”).
* **Arson Evidence**:
  * **Fuse jars** under crates; **wedge** to control oil leak; kindling stacked like a ladder.
  * **Standard door fire ward** found with **key stroke cut** (sabotage).
  * **Dock Lions** present with calm + cheap iron lion badges (pour seam visible); implies trained help.
* **Marked Lead**: runner takes **Rope Lane** service alley; **tar‑stained door** with plaque recently removed (clean square). Haruto **marks door in red** using chili oil smear (improvised “tracking dye”). Plan: **return in daylight** to document.
* **Civilians First**: frees a child pinned by a barrel; coordinates lifts (“numbers before verbs”).
* **Method**: **Mark, don’t bark** — lets runner go in favor of marked route/door; avoids civilian panic.
* **Watch Contact**: unnamed **chipped‑tooth watchman** accepts Haruto’s report; asks for evidence rather than names.
* **Notebook (verbatim‑style items)**:
  * Quay Nine — **not** accident. Fuse jars. Wedge. Ward scratched.
  * Runner route → Rope Lane **tar door** (**red smear**).
  * **Plaque removed** (clean square).
  * Cost: thinking drains fuel fast. Bring food or crash.
  * No feather sign tonight. **Don’t force pattern.**
  * Return by daylight. **Check that door.**

## Chapter 3 — Canon Notes (Added for RAG)

* **Scene**: Morning after Quay Nine; Greyreach docks; echo wire resumes normal clicks; **rune‑thread (quiet ward)** draped across unsafe thresholds; Rope Lane **tar door** still marked red (chilli smear intact).
* **Haruto (method today)**: exits mapped first; eats before fieldwork (Naomi enforces “eat first”); uses **graphite rubbing**, **hand‑span/step counts**, **micro‑samples**; files hard evidence, withholds sensitive lead (egg) = **deferred truth**.
* **Evidence & Forensics (Ch.3)**  
  * Fire counter‑ward: **corner stroke cut at 45°** (clean knife line → trained sabotage).  
  * Plaque void: **9×12 hand‑spans**; **screws sheared** (not rust‑failed).  
  * Residue: **lamp‑oil wick flakes**; **jar‑neck glass pitted by fast heat**.  
  * Floor find: **leather carrier ring** that holds multiple **fuse jars** (charred).
* **Encounters**  
  * **Dock Lion** lingers at lane mouth; intimidates without escalation; **cheap iron lion badge** shows visible **pour seam** (image over craft) → *pressure present*.  
  * **Chipped‑tooth watchman** accepts rubbing; asks for **plaque photo** if found; warns **Lions are sniffing**; “*That we can file*.”  
  * **Naomi Kuroda** force‑feeds skewers/dumplings; line: “**Food is a down payment on not being stupid**;” pan‑bang “gong” gag.
* **Egg discovery (pre‑Mochi canon)**  
  * Under collapsed crate: **warm, humming egg** despite rain/bucket lines; hum syncs softly with ambient rhythms.  
  * **Heat/steam calms egg** (street steamer; kettle at home); wrapped in **Naomi’s hot paper**; soot‑streaked.  
  * Haruto keeps it **secret now** (lowest‑cost line), intends to report when safe.
* **Evermind — observed today**: highlights weak boards as faint “ghost lines” (short‑horizon hazard map); favors **cheapest line** (ignore confrontation, finish documentation).
* **Notebook (verbatim‑style items)**  
  * **Cut‑ward corner stroke**: knife line **45°** → **trained sabotage**.  
  * **Chili mark** intact on tar door.  
  * **Plaque area 9×12** hand‑spans; **screws sheared**.  
  * Residue: **lamp‑oil wick**; **jar‑neck** glass **pitted** by fast heat.  
  * **Carrier ring** char at floor center.  
  * Return with a **rubbing copy** for the watch **today**.  
  * Watch cautioned: **Lions sniffing**; **avoid hero speeches**.  
  * **Food rule** holds (brain outruns legs without snack).  
  * *(Private margin note — deferred)*: **Unnatural heat** under soaked debris → **investigate source later**.

## Chapter 4 — Canon Notes (Added for RAG)

* **Scene**: Early morning in Haruto’s room (kettle steaming; echo‑wire slow boat codes); market route past Naomi; Rope Lane **tar door** (Ch.2 chili smear still intact); bell post; Rope Lane ink‑shop corner (Grey‑Cap).
* **Haruto (method today)**: runs “kitchen science” micro‑trials; writes clean bullet logs; **maps exits before leaving** (Exit→Enter rule); practices **Mark, don’t bark** and **Pick battles you can finish** in field interactions.
* **Egg (pre‑hatch behavior)**  
  * **Responses**: heat/steam **↑ hum**; steam + food aroma **↑↑ hum**; **dumpling held above shell (no contact)** **↑↑ hum**; surface shows **fine traceries under glaze** (not cracks).  
  * **Home care protocol (drafted today)**: **steam 60–90 sec / every 2–3 hrs** (home); keep wrap warm; use aroma cue (esp. dumplings) to calm; **no direct flame / no cold shock**; **don’t jostle; no stairs at speed**; if carried outside → warm cloth; **avoid Lions**.  
  * **Deferred truth**: **log privately now; file once stabilized + owner/ritual link identified**.
* **Evidence & Forensics (today)**  
  * Counter‑ward: **corner stroke cut @ 45°** (matches Ch.3 trained sabotage).  
  * Plaque void: **9×12 hand‑spans**; **screws sheared (flat shine)**.  
  * **New**: **two tread patterns** by the void; **one heel drags each step** → likely **injury or heavy carry**; **direction toward canal**.  
  * Bucket‑line **chalk marker** on cobbles (keep lane clear during fires).  
  * At Grey‑Cap’s stall: **metal plates**; one with **sheared screws still clinging**; Haruto takes **graphite spacing rubbing** (lets him match stolen plaques later).
* **Encounters**  
  * **Dock Lion (lane mouth)** — presses without violence; badge **pour seam** still visible; Haruto de‑escalates (“paper before names”).  
  * **Naomi Kuroda** — “**Eat first**”; **pan‑bang “GONG”** gag; slips a **“for later”** food packet (covers egg hum in public).  
  * **Two Dock Lions at stall** — try “**fire season** fee”; Haruto uses **bucket‑line chalk** safety pretext to redirect; momentum‑seeking, leave with a look (“we’ll remember”).  
  * **Bell‑post watchman (chipped tooth)** — accepts **duplicate rubbing + measurements**; line **“That we can file.”** Likes **paper before names**; repeats **Lions sniffing** warning.  
  * **Grey‑Cap Fence** — “sells art” (wall plates); confirms **wall‑item stripping pattern**; Haruto buys a bent spoon (cover) and records screw spacing from a plate.  
  * **Kenta Mori** — confirms Grey‑Cap’s habits; brings a **grease‑spotted “cookbook” notebook**; two big men are seeking it; establish **Skewer Scouts knock: tap‑tap…tap**.
* **Codes & Leads (today)**  
  * **Cookbook Courier Ledger** discovered: **spice words** stand for **route/time**; **capitals** mark **posts**; **blank lines** mark **delays**.  
  * Partial key (margin note seen): **bay = bell**, **cumin = canal**, **clove = court**.  
  * Plan: **decode in morning**; tie to **canal runner** routes.
* **Notebook (verbatim‑style items)**  
  * **Steam + aroma → hum ↑↑** (no shell contact).  
  * **Care**: steam cycle 60–90 sec / 2–3 hrs; warm wrap; no cold shock; **avoid Lions**.  
  * Ward **45° cut** (trained); plaque **9×12**; **sheared screws** shine.  
  * **Treads ×2**; **heel drag**; **vector → canal**.  
  * **Bucket‑line chalk** at stall — don’t block.  
  * **Grey‑Cap** has plate with **sheared screws**; took **spacing rubbing**.  
  * **Cookbook ledger** uses **spices = signals**; **bay/bell; cumin/canal; clove/court**.  
  * **Skewer Scouts knock**: **tap‑tap…tap**.  
  * **Deferred truth timer** running.
