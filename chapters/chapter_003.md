# Chapter 3 — Ash, Door, Egg

Morning made the docks look honest.

Steam lifted off soaked timbers. Rune‑thread—thin blue string that held a quiet ward—crisscrossed doorways like humble ribbons. Chalk sigils marked houses that had lent their buckets, and the echo wire along the street had found its voice again, clicking boat codes in a nervous, polite rhythm.

Haruto stood at the edge of Quay Nine and did what Kanzaki had taught him to do even before the Evermind: he chose his exits first. *Street to east; canal stairs two lengths right; rope ladder over the barge rail; alley with the tar door—still there; a cart gap near Naomi’s stall.* The committee in his head hummed a yes. Calm clicked into place like teeth.

His stomach clicked too, but in a different way.

Naomi intercepted him at speed, thrusting a skewer under his nose like a weapon. “Eat first,” she said, eyes sweeping up to the bandage in his hair and back down to the wobble in his knees. “If you pass out I’m charging the watch for carting you.”

“Public‑private partnership,” Haruto said, biting before his dignity could object. “Noted.”

She glared until half the skewer was gone and then shoved a paper packet into his free hand. “For later, which means in five minutes. I’m boiling dumplings. I hear you thinking from here.”

“That’s the lamps,” he said around a mouthful, but the joke landed anyway. She snorted and banged her ladle against a pan in a way that sounded satisfyingly like a small gong.

The chipped‑tooth watchman was at the bell post again, soot streaks fresh over a washed face. He gave Haruto a nod that was closer to a *come back with something* than a greeting.

“Minute to walk the lane?” Haruto asked, holding up his packet like a peace offering to the universe.

“Don’t touch the collapse,” the watchman said. “Thread marks say the floor’ll sulk if you look at it wrong. You got that door for me?”

“Working it now.”

The watchman jerked his chin. “Go.”

Haruto moved through the steam and the scoldings and the quiet industry without making waves, the way he had learned to slip past anger to reach the task. The Evermind peeled sounds apart—wire clicks over footsteps, footsteps over the hiss of damp embers, embers over the faint groan of a beam settling to remember its weight.

*Feed first or crash.* He lifted the packet Naomi had shoved into his hand. The heat soaked through the paper and into his skin in a way that felt like a reminder and a dare.

He turned into Rope Lane.

---

The tar door wore his chilli smear like a jaunty ribbon. The color had dried a dull red, stubborn even after the night’s rain. The clean square where a plaque had been pried away looked almost indecent, like a shirt missing a button. Rust dust flecked the screws that had been sheared clean rather than coaxed out.

Haruto crouched and let the committee lay out a plan.

*Document. Sample. Sketch. Don’t be interesting.* He pinched the paper packet between his elbow and his ribs and slid his notebook out.

He took a graphite stick and rubbed a gentle, even stroke over the corner of the fire counter‑ward etched into the door frame. The key line that should have sealed the glyph was cut precisely at a diagonal; a trained hand and a clean knife. He caught the angle in the rubbing, labeled it.

He took a sliver of wick residue with a thumbnail and teased it into a folded scrap of paper. The flake came away black and stubborn. Lamp oil ghosted up even now.

He stepped back three paces and mapped distances in the moss and brick with the same easy habit his mind had about exits. “Numbers before verbs,” he murmured, measuring with his palm. “Nine by twelve hand‑spans for the plaque. Step count to canal—twenty‑three at my pace. Two scuffs from a run aimed at water.”

He sketched the lane, the placement of the hanging line he’d bumped last night, and the spot where the nets had slumped across two men’s shins like helpful seaweed. He resisted the urge to grin in nostalgia. *Don’t date your notes,* Kanzaki would say. *The past wasn’t as cute as you remember.*

Footsteps stopped at the mouth of the lane.

Haruto didn’t need to look up to picture the man. The badge told him. Rough iron lion with a seam visible along the mane—a cheap pour line. The Dock Lions liked to go heavy on image when real craft cost coin.

“You’re very interested in doors,” the man said. His voice had the flat warmth of a threat rehearsed too often. He leaned on the wall and let the seam show.

Haruto kept his pencil moving. “I’m interested in the corner stroke on a ward cut wrong. And in screws sheared in a hurry.” He blew a little graphite dust off the page. “And in how your badge mold needs a file.”

“You talking to me?”

“Mostly to my notebook.”

Silence stretched, thin and watchful. The committee in Haruto’s head flared three options. *Confront. Report. Ignore.* He chose the cheapest line. “If you see someone reorganizing fire wards,” he added pleasantly, “tell them it’s illegal and boring.”

The man’s jaw worked. “You got a name, kid?”

“Haruto. Sworn to dumplings.” He tucked the residue paper away, met the man’s eyes long enough to register the look, then looked past him at the exit, the rope ladder in the distance, the cart gap by Naomi’s stall.

The lion badge tilted his head, hummed an answer Haruto couldn’t hear, and sauntered away, trying to make his spine say *we see you* without his feet ever committing. Haruto let him have the exit. He wasn’t worth a different one.

He made one more note.

— Dock Lion lingered. Didn’t bite. *Pressure present.*

He snapped the notebook shut and slipped it back into his coat. His fingers brushed the warm packet again. His stomach made its case.

“Two more minutes,” he promised his body, which was the tone you used with a toddler who had the upper hand.

He went to the warehouse.

---

Rune‑thread fluttered lazy at the broken threshold, its glow a little sullen in daylight. The watch had looped it in a pattern Haruto had learned to respect—enough to tell citizens “step wrong and fall through” and enough to tell investigators “ask first.”

“Permission?” he called back over his shoulder.

“Minute,” the watchman said, not looking up from a slate. “Don’t test the floor. It’s temperamental.”

Haruto nodded to the thread as if it were an old aunt and stepped across. The Evermind’s short horizon lit the weak boards like faint ghost lines; they weren’t bright, but they were there. He paced his steps around the worst of them and held his breath because even breathing felt like a push sometimes.

Inside was a belly of a beast after a meal—warm, wet, and quiet in the way a thing is quiet because it’s tired, not because it wants to be.

On the floor, near where a crate had slumped to its knees, a half‑melted ring of leather held the collar ghosts of glass necks. He crouched and picked a point where the heat hadn’t eaten the whole story. Each neck had the same flea‑bite scoring where a wick would have sat. A tidy carrier for fuse jars. The ring smelled like oil and regret.

Haruto shifted his weight, and something behind a collapsed crate whispered heat.

He turned his head and saw a pocket—straw, singed at the tips; burlap, crisped; a curl like a nest. It shouldn’t have been warm anymore. Not this long after a night with bucket lines and rain. But heat moved off it in a low, steady breath.

His hand moved before the rest of him did. He reached between broken slats and told his weight to be a guest instead of a tenant. His fingers met smooth.

He made contact with a curve the size of his forearm, smooth under soot, warmer than his skin by the amount a stove is warm in the next room. When he adjusted his grip, the curve hummed.

The hum was faint. It was more suggestion than sound. But in Haruto’s head, the committee straightened in their chairs. *Oh,* he thought. *That lines up with the click.*

He rolled the thing gently, easing it out of its straw pocket, and his brain supplied a word it had no right to be sure of: *egg.*

“Okay,” he whispered. “All right. Hello.”

He checked the nest for glyphs or salvageable markings. No brand burned into the straw. No chalk sigil half‑erased. He wiped the egg with the damp hem of his coat and found only soot and one thin line like a vein. The humming didn’t stop; if anything, it found a rhythm with the wet lamps outside.

“Evidence, please don’t hatch in my pocket,” he told it in the same voice he used for skittish cats and overconfident plans.

The egg didn’t answer. It only hummed the way your throat does when you try not to laugh and fail in a very small way.

He wrapped it in the still‑warm paper Naomi had given him without thinking about symbolism and slid it under his coat against his belly. Heat radiated back into him and the old part of his brain that liked soup and blankets made a pleased sound.

*Report now?* the committee asked.

*Report what?* he asked back. *Unregistered, living… something?* The threads laid themselves out. *If it is contraband, calling it contraband puts it into the hands of the wrong sort right now. If it is a familiar egg, the wrong kind of mage will take it for study. If it is a victim, it deserves more than a file number.*

Secrecy was the lowest‑cost line. For now.

He backed out the way he came, retracing steps on boards that complained only a little under his careful weight. He didn’t look different. His coat stuck out only as much as a man hiding food.

Which, to be fair, he was.

---

The watchman angled a look at him the second he cleared the threshold. Haruto didn’t break stride. He laid the graphite rubbing on the bell post like an offering.

“Corner stroke cut,” he said. “Clean angle at forty‑five. Whoever did it practiced. Plaque area nine by twelve hand‑spans—screws sheared, not rusted. Wick residue. Jar‑neck carrier ring inside.”

The watchman’s eyes tracked the notes and didn’t attempt to look inside Haruto’s coat, which was a grace Haruto tried to deserve by breathing normally. “No names?”

“Better,” Haruto said. “Angles and a missing stroke.”

The watchman tucked the rubbing into a leather folder with an expression that should have been a thank‑you but wasn’t allowed to be. “That we can file,” he said, which in watch language might as well be *good job.* He lowered his voice. “The Lions were sniffing for who snooped. You keep your head down.”

“I keep my head where Naomi can throw spoons at it,” Haruto said.

As if summoned, Naomi banged her pan again. The clang covered a small, treacherous *vrmmm* from under Haruto’s coat right when the watchman’s hand landed on his shoulder to move him aside for a cart.

Haruto coughed in a way that suggested *I swallowed air and also a poor decision,* and the watchman let go. Naomi yelled at a customer for trying to pay with a bent coin, and the city carried on pretending it didn’t keep secrets for boys with notebooks.

“Bring the picture of the plaque if you find it,” the watchman added, scratching the chip in his tooth with his tongue. “We’re past rumors. We need lines we can pull.”

“Working with boring patience,” Haruto said, which made the watchman huff as if surprised to find they shared a language.

Haruto stepped back. The egg under his coat did a polite little purr. He pressed his elbow into it gently like a friend bumping a friend. *Later.*

“Haruto!” Naomi called without looking at him. “If you’re going to pass out, pass out near a chair. I only have two arms.”

“I’ll rent a third,” he said. He drifted toward her stall because his route home went past it and because the egg had warmed the paper into a smell that made the part of him with taste buds try to make executive decisions.

He stopped with one hand on the steamer lid and then remembered he was a person not a raccoon. “I owe you,” he said. “Again.”

“You owe me rent,” she said. “Food is a down payment on not being stupid.”

“I’ll write that down.” He meant it. He would. He’d probably even underline it.

She softened for a blink. “You look steadier,” she said. “Your eyes stop jumping if I feed you. That makes me feel very powerful.”

“Confirming your control of the city,” he said. “One dumpling at a time.”

He moved on before he said something warmer than she liked in public. Naomi thrived on scolding, not gratitude. Gratitude was saved for when the bell stopped ringing and friends went home.

He folded into the side alley and let the drag of the city pull him along. The Evermind’s map overlaid the real lanes until the two were the same thing.

*Exit before enter,* he reminded himself, even now. He stitched together a route—no doubled‑back tracks, no main street linger, no chance for a Lion to step out of a doorway and mistake curiosity for permission.

Halfway down Rope Lane, a cook lifted the lid off a street steamer. A column of fragrant vapor wandered out with the delicate arrogance of a cat.

The egg hummed soft against his ribs like a question.

“Oh,” he said, because sometimes the world was helpful to a degree that felt rude. He stopped, let the steam curl around the front of his coat, and watched the egg’s hum gather into a warmer, steadier line.

*If food calms me… what calms you?* he thought, and the answer was as direct as a tug: heat.

He walked again, slower now. He made himself file things first because that was how he was still alive. He had receipts to deliver and a secret to consider.

---

Up two flights in his building, the joiner across the alley had shifted from saw‑snore to planing‑snore. Haruto shut his door with his heel and set the packet Naomi had given him on the table. He pulled his coat carefully over his head and held his breath for a heartbeat.

The egg came free like a reluctant thought. It sat in his hands with the confidence of a rock that had hired a musician. Warmth soaked into his palms. Soot streaked his sleeves and didn’t care.

He set it on the table on a folded shirt because he had not yet paid enough rent to scorch furniture and lifted the lid on his kettle.

Steam rose. The egg hummed, a little brighter.

“Right,” Haruto said. “Not food. But close.”

He eased the kettle closer and let heat slide across the curve. The hum matched the kettle’s whisper the way his Evermind had matched the bell last night. His brain liked patterns. His brain, apparently, also liked eggs.

He sat, because he wasn’t an idiot. Then he pulled his notebook across the table and wrote clean.

— Cut‑ward corner stroke: **knife line** at forty‑five. Trained sabotage.

— **Chili mark** intact on tar door.

— Plaque area **9×12 hand‑spans**. Screws **sheared**.

— Residue: **lamp‑oil wick** flakes; jar‑neck glass **pitted** by fast heat.

— **Carrier ring** char at center of floor.

He paused. The pencil hovered. The egg hummed, faint and pleased.

He did not add a line about the egg.

He glanced at the page anyway and wrote a tiny, secret note in the margin where only he would look:

— **Unnatural heat** under soaked debris → investigate **source** later.

“That’s not a lie,” he told the air. “It’s a deferred truth.”

The kettle clicked to a mutter and then to an embarrassed quiet. The egg’s hum lowered to an idle purr, the kind you feel more than hear.

Haruto rubbed at his eyes and found the shape of a smile sneaking up the side of his face. “You’re a problem,” he told the egg. “I’m already fond of you. That’s two problems.”

The committee made a noise that might have been a vote and might have been a sigh.

He stood and set the kettle on the far edge of the table where it could lend warmth without encouraging disaster. He dug in the packet for a dumpling because he had been very brave and also because not eating would be lying to his rules. He ate one, then another, then a third, because simple plans fed themselves.

He set his fingers on the egg the way you check a friend’s forehead. It warmed under his touch and gave a small *vrmmm* that vibrated his bones.

“Don’t,” he said, half‑laughing, half‑panicked. “Do not hatch in my pocket. Or on my table. Or right now. Ten minutes.”

The egg did not hatch. It only existed in the room in a way that shifted the center of gravity a notch. His little world had another mass in it now. His exits had to account for that.

*Exit before enter,* he reminded himself. *Mark. Don’t bark. Pick battles you can finish.* He added a new line in his head: *Hide weird egg before showing face at the watch.*

He wrapped the egg again, not fully; just enough to take the edge off the shine, leaving it a warm bundle. He slid it under the table where steam still reached and sat back down.

His pencil skritched.

— Return with a **rubbing** copy for the watch. (Do this today.)

— Watch cautioned: Lions **sniffing**. Avoid hero speeches.

— **Food rule** holds. Brain outruns legs without snack.

He underlined *food rule* twice. His stomach bumped his elbow in solidarity.

The egg hummed in perfect time with the rune‑lamp’s quiet hum outside.

He looked at the steamer in his mind, then at the egg, then at the kettle. He was not ready to write: *dragon.* He was not ready to be the sort of person who said: *I found a dragon egg in a fire and took it home because my brain told me to.*

He was ready to say: “If food calms me… what calms you?” He said it aloud like a promise.

Down in the lane, someone pushed a cart. The wheels squeaked. The joiner turned over to snore in a slightly different key. The echo wire clicked a code for barley boats arriving late.

Haruto reached for the kettle and tipped the spout a fraction.

The egg answered with a soft *vrmmm* that settled in his fingertips and up his arm.

“Okay,” he said. “We’ll start there.”

He smiled, thin and helpless.

Steam curled around his hands like a question mark as the egg hummed once, hungry. Then he tucked the warmth into his coat’s shadow and mapped his path to the door, the lowest‑cost line rising up ahead of him like a good idea waiting for feet.
