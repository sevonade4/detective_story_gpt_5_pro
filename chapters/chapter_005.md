# Chapter 5 — Lunch Codes

The kettle started its whisper. Steam rose in a thin column that bent when Haruto moved it over the egg.

“Sixty,” he counted, and the egg’s hum leveled like a line being ruled straight across paper. “Seventy. Eighty. Ninety.”

He eased the kettle back and cracked open Naomi’s paper packet. Dumplings breathed out ginger and chive. He held one above the shell—a priest of snacks blessing a congregant—close enough for warmth and scent, never touching.

The hum jumped two notches. Not louder—steadier. Content.

“You hum, I read,” Haruto told it. “Division of labor.”

He ate the control dumpling. His Evermind committee—how he thought of it now that the world inside his head had seats—put items on the agenda.

*Agenda: turn kitchen words into routes. Cost: calories. Constraint: don’t spook the city. Exit before enter.*

He laid out tools on the table: the grease‑spotted “cookbook,” his own notebook, two pencils (one sharp, one blunt for margin marks), a twine bookmark, a scrap map of Greyreach’s canals drawn on cheap paper, and a graphite stub. He added a small chalk nub. Then he wrote the day’s starting facts at the top of his page in clean bullets:

— **bay = bell**
— **cumin = canal**
— **clove = court**
— **CAPS = post stop**
— **blank line = delay/hold**

He paused long enough to eat one more dumpling because *focus rides on food.* His stomach stopped trying to unionize.

“Deferred truth,” he said to the egg and his empty room. “Log first. File later.”

He planned the route to and from Naomi’s in his head—the stairwell noise for cover, market edge, stall, bell post, lamp yard corner, rope ladder on the barge if everything went sideways.

The committee voted. He wrapped the egg again, warm cloth over shirt, top loose so steam could slip in. Then he stepped out.

---

Naomi’s stall ran on heat and spine. Steam drifted in good manners from stacked baskets. The pan gave its flat metallic *GONG* when her ladle hit it. People in three lanes turned their heads on instinct.

“You’re pale,” Naomi said, and shoved a skewer toward him. “Eat first. Food is a down payment on not being stupid.”

“I am paying in installments,” Haruto said. He bit; glaze and char landed, and the committee settled in their chairs. He stopped fidgeting. His eyes stopped trying to watch five exits at once.

The egg hummed under his coat with a polite cough. Naomi’s second *GONG* covered it. She didn’t comment. She slid a lidded steamer tray to the side, making space on the counter with the same motion that cleared a path and set a cover. The lid hovered conveniently over a patch of bare wood.

Kenta appeared, all elbows and grin, and knocked the counter with the **Skewer Scouts** pattern: tap‑tap…tap. He held up a string tied around the cookbook like a ribbon.

“Marked today’s page,” he whispered, pleased with himself.

“Good,” Haruto said. He set the book down as if they were about to argue about soup thickness. Naomi flipped the steamer lid back a fraction and lowered it so it could become a casual privacy screen. People passing saw bowls and steam. No one saw spice words.

“Review the key,” Haruto said, not bothering with drama.

“Bay is bell. Cumin is canal,” Kenta recited, proud. “Clove is court. Capitals mean stop at an official post, not just vibe near it. Blank line means wait.”

“And three spices in a line is a sequence,” Haruto said. “Sometimes four. Sometimes a scribble number for timing.”

Naomi nodded once. “And the whole thing is stupid because someone taught runners to hide crime in cooking.”

“Smart as well,” Haruto said. “Because cooks don’t invite suspicion.”

“Cooks also have ladles,” Naomi said, deadpan, “and time to aim.”

She pointed with her chin at a line on the page.

It read, in neat blocky hand:

cumin  bay  
               CLOVE

A blank space sat between *bay* and *CLOVE* like a bench.

“Canal, bell, hold, court,” Haruto said. “Ride the canal until you hear the bell. Stall. Then move to the court steps.”

“Simple enough to be real,” Naomi said.

A few lines down:

cumin  **BAY**  9

“BAY in capitals,” Kenta said, poking the page. “And a nine.”

“Bell Post Nine,” Naomi said without missing a beat. “Quay Nine.”

“That fits the arson night traffic,” Haruto said. He kept his voice even. *Don’t force a pattern. Let it arrive.*

Two Dock Lions drifted through the flow then, their badges cheap iron with a visible pour seam where the mane should have been clean. One tapped Naomi’s tip jar with two fingers. Coins chimed. He tilted his head like he’d invented gravity.

“Fire season,” he said, syrup laid over the words. “Fees adjust.”

Naomi’s face reached a place above weather. “My stall didn’t change,” she said, calm as embroidery. “Only your mouth.”

Haruto shifted half a step sideways, posture apologetic, angle careful, so they had to detour around the chalk line on the cobbles that marked the bucket lane. He didn’t block. He pointed at the line without looking at the men.

“Don’t stand on that,” he said in a neutral, helpful tone. “People run when bells ring. They’ll trip. You’ll be liable.”

Lion #2 glanced down. Pride doesn’t like to look, but feet like not tripping more. They moved two steps. Lion #1 studied Haruto’s coat; the man’s look snagged on a seam that didn’t show and didn’t understand why. He left a promise in his eyes: *we’ll remember.*

Naomi hit the pan again. *GONG.* The lid over the ledger wobbled as if by accident and settled. The egg’s hum smoothed out under the sound. She slid a dumpling across the counter like a coded *keep it calm.*

Kenta leaned in closer, stage‑whisper low. “I saw a string like this—CUMIN CUMIN BAY—on a Tuesday page,” he said. “Double canal before bell. That mean two turns?”

“Two canal cuts, then angle to a bell,” Haruto said. “The blank line after tells the runner to stall until the actual ring hits. It’s a good way to sync without a clock.”

Naomi poured soup, set bowls in front of them, and adjusted the steamer lid a hair to hide the way Haruto used his blunt pencil on the margin:

— **cumin → bay (blank) → CLOVE**
— **CUMIN CUMIN BAY** = double cut before bell alignment
— **BAY 9** = Bell Post Nine

“Numbers before verbs,” Haruto said under his breath, pleased. “We can test a midday string now.”

“Eat first,” Naomi said, because repetition makes truth stick.

Haruto ate. The committee in his head dotted an i.

---

The bell post sat like a patient metal throat at the canal. The chipped‑tooth watchman leaned against it in the universal pose of men who had slept only a little and were prepared to be sensible anyway.

“I brought boring,” Haruto said, because it was a shared joke now. He had nothing in his hands but a list: dredge schedules from last week, a question about triple rings at midday, and a note about single dusk rings for barge clearance.

“That we can file,” the watchman said, when Haruto finished. He slid the written bit into a leather folder and tapped it. “Yes to triple ring on dredge days. Today isn’t one, so expect the straight single at dusk for the barge.” He narrowed his eyes. “You not asking for names?”

“I like paper before names,” Haruto said.

“Names get loud,” the watchman said.

“Paper gets patient,” Haruto returned.

They let the rhythm of that sit. The watchman scratched his chin with a knuckle and looked past Haruto toward the market.

“Lions are sniffing for whoever thinks in lanes,” he said. “Keep your head where a vendor can hit it with a spoon.”

“Pre‑contracted spoon coverage,” Haruto said.

The man snorted. “That we can also file.”

Haruto didn’t show him the ledger. The promise he’d written to himself—*deferred truth*—wasn’t a trick; it was a plan. He nodded, thanked the man, and moved.

---

They made their little war room two corners from the lamp yard, where a fence sagged in a way that gave shade and privacy without privacy signaling being obvious. Haruto laid the map scrap on the fence plank and marked with chalk:

cumin → bay (blank) → CLOVE

He drew it as a loop: canal cut east along the lamp yard, hold in a shadowed alley mouth one street shy of the bell post, then a straight line to the courthouse steps.

“Roles,” he said. “Naomi—keep the ledger at the stall. Safer there. If anyone asks, it’s a real cookbook. Kenta—you watch the lamp yard corner. I want to see what runners actually do during blank lines. I’ll be where I can hear the bells clean and count feet.”

“We need hand signals,” Kenta said seriously. “For hold and move.”

Haruto raised two fingers and tapped his wrist with them. “Hold is two taps. Move is a circle motion like you’re stirring soup.”

Kenta made a flamboyant swirl that would have played well in the theatre district. Naomi reached out and pushed his wrist down half an inch so the motion didn’t catch eyes.

“Subtle,” she said. She found a grease pencil, crossed out the flamboyant version in imaginary air, and mimed a smaller stir with the tiniest sigh. “Learn to be boring. The city rewards boring.”

“The Ladle League,” Kenta said, whisper‑grand. “We’ll do boring with style.”

“No,” Naomi said.

“Skewer Scouts for the kids,” Haruto said before Kenta could sulk. “Adult units file reports.”

Kenta brightened. “I’ll file a report with a drawing.”

“Paper before names,” Haruto said. He rolled the map and tucked it inside his coat behind the egg, which hummed like a cat asleep, unaware of patrol duties.

*Numbers before verbs,* he reminded himself. *Count the rings before you chase boots.*

---

Midday brought light that flattened shadows. The rune‑lamps along the canal hummed softer when dry; the sound laid under the city like a hand under paper. When the bell gave its single warning tap for the noon mark, everyone in earshot adjusted something—hats, pace, load. It was a rhythm learned young.

The actual sequence they wanted to test began three breaths later. Kenta was in position at the lamp yard corner, eyes sharp but face bored. Naomi’s stall looked like food and supplies and nothing else. Haruto leaned against a post with a line of sight to the bell and to the alley they had picked for the blank line hold.

The bell rang.

Not the emergency cascade—just a clean civic tone, the kind that told boatmen to clear a stretch of water or switch shifts. On that note, a man with a cap pulled low turned at the canal edge and took the first cut: **cumin**.

Haruto’s pencil ticked in his pocket. He watched without staring. The man flowed with three other bodies and made the second water turn—**cumin** again—then angled toward the bell, then stopped dead at the alley mouth they had marked for the blank line. He didn’t lean or pretend to fix a boot. He simply existed there, ordinary as a nail in a fence, for a count of ten.

Kenta tapped his own wrist twice against the fence post—**hold**—and then drew a small circle—**move**—when the bell’s second arrangement of tones drifted over the roofline. The man peeled away from the hold and walked eyes‑down along a straight path to the courthouse steps. **CLOVE.**

The three of them did not look at each other. That would break the test.

A Dock Lion stood in the shadow across from the hold point. He didn’t escort the runner. He watched the stop itself. Haruto memorized his badge—cheap iron, visible pour seam on the mane—and the way the man leaned: weight on right leg, left turned slightly out. The runner’s shoes said other things; the left toe scuffed off the cobble on starts. No heel drag. Not their plaque thief from the tar door. Different gait, different problem.

Haruto let his breath out slow. *The book isn’t a recipe. It’s a clock in an apron.*

He timed foot traffic with his inner metronome, counted how the crowd occluded the alley mouth, marked how often a passerby made cover without meaning to.

Kenta walked past him then, casual, and said to no one, “Soup’s good today.”

Haruto followed him three steps later, as if to agree with lunch, and they took a side lane that angled back toward Naomi. Naomi was exactly as they had left her: serving bowls, banging the pan, steering two tourists around the bucket‑line chalk with the ease of a woman who had decided she would not permit broken ankles near her stall.

“Confirmed,” Haruto said low when they had the steamer lid’s cover again. “cumin → bay (blank) → CLOVE works. And someone watches the hold point.”

Naomi’s eyes flicked once toward the lane where the Lion had loitered and then back to his face. “We don’t fetch attention to the chalk,” she said.

“We won’t,” Haruto said. “We will wait for dusk and see what **BAY 9** looks like in the wild.”

Kenta tried to keep all his teeth behind his lips and failed. “We just read time with soup,” he whispered, unable to help himself.

Haruto couldn’t not smile at that. “Write it down,” he said.

Kenta, thrilled, pulled out a stub and scrawled on the edge of a wrapper:

— spices = routes/timing
— confirmed midday loop (lamp yard → bell → court)
— dusk string mentions **BAY 9** (Quay Nine)
— hold points observed by Lions

Naomi slid a bowl toward a man who looked like a grandfather made of knotted rope. Her motions didn’t falter. Her voice stayed the same.

“Two big boys came by earlier asking if anyone has been ‘reading recipes out loud,’” she said as if she were naming vegetables. “I asked if they wanted soup.”

“They always want soup,” Haruto said.

“They didn’t order,” Naomi said. “So I told them I only answer to people who pay.”

Haruto added a small star next to *two big boys ask around.* He drew a box around **BAY 9**. Then he tapped the cookbook.

“We’re not carrying this around anymore,” he said. “Too loud. We’ll copy pages by hand. Naomi, hide the book inside a real cookbook here. The one with the red spine and the oil stain on page two.”

“I have five red spines,” Naomi said.

“Use the one that looks like it’s survived a flood,” Haruto said.

Naomi flipped the cookbook open, scribbled a very real noodle recipe with exact quantities on the first blank page as camouflage, and slid the ledger inside it as if she had been hiding codes all her life. She placed it on a shelf behind sauce jars. It looked so safe it was almost smug.

“Ledger doesn’t leave the stall for now,” she said.

“Agreed,” Haruto said.

“Copies by hand only,” she added.

“Agreed,” Haruto said.

“Eat something before you plan the dusk route,” she said, and banged the pan at exactly the right time to cover the egg’s tiny contented vibration.

“Already ahead of you,” he said. He wasn’t. He ate anyway.

---

Back in his room he repeated the care cycle because consistency keeps promises honest.

Steam for ninety. Dumpling above shell. Hum steady.

He wrote the day’s decode where he could find it fast:

— **bay = bell; cumin = canal; clove = court** (**field‑confirmed**)
— **CAPS = official post stop**
— **blank line = delay/hold**
— **Midday loop** matches lamp yard → bell → court (observed)
— **Evening line** refers to **BAY 9 = Bell Post Nine (Quay Nine)**
— **Lions observed** watching **hold** points
— **Do not** show ledger; **copy pages by hand**; stash ledger inside real cookbook at Naomi’s

He labeled the next action:

— **Dusk test @ Quay Nine** (observe only; **Mark, don’t bark**)

He closed the notebook. The city’s sound came through the window in layers: a boatman’s shout, the dry hum of rune‑lamps when the mist lifted, far click‑codes from the echo wire warming back to life after the noon lull. Somewhere closer a boy tried to whistle and found a new way to do it wrong.

Haruto set the kettle to a softer whisper and stood a moment with his palm over the egg, not touching, feeling heat. *You hum, I file. We keep each other from stupid.*

The distant bell gave a single dusk test ring for the barge clearance. It walked through the canal rows like a polite warning. The echo wire stuttered back on a beat later.

A knock came, soft and quick. **Tap‑tap…tap.**

Haruto opened. Kenta filled the doorway with breath he clearly needed and didn’t take, eyes bright with good news that had flipped its coat to become a problem.

“Two big boys bought bowls from Mrs. Panya two stalls over,” Kenta said, words fast but crisp. “Then asked her if she heard anyone reading ‘a cookbook like a fool.’ She pointed at a fisherman just to be difficult. They laughed. They’re asking everyone near the bell posts for who likes recipes, and one of them has a heel drag just like your drawing from Rope Lane.”

Haruto’s Evermind put that next to the plate void and the canal vector and underlined a phrase: *same heel drag.* He didn’t say it out loud.

“Okay,” he said. Calm is contagious. He passed Kenta a cup and made him drink water before the boy could pass out on the excitement. “Here’s what we do.”

He held up two fingers. “One: we eat fast. Two: we keep our mouths closed. We watch the bell.”

Kenta nodded so seriously it hurt. “Skewer Scouts,” he said, tiny and fierce.

“Skewer Scouts,” Haruto agreed.

He shut the door, grabbed his coat, checked the egg wrap, and let the committee run one last vote.

Exit before enter. Bell before boots. Paper before names.

He stepped back into the city.
