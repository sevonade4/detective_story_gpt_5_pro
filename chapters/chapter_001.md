# Chapter 1 — Skewers & Shadows

The drizzle came soft as steam, floating off the canal and collecting on the rune‑lamps until they hummed like bees. Greyreach’s twilight market pressed close along the water—canvas awnings, sizzling pans, a spill of people moving shoulder to shoulder beneath paper shades painted with fish and moons.

Haruto Sato stood where the crowd thinned by a gutter, coins warm in his palm and hunger louder than the hawkers.

“Two skewers,” he said to the woman working the small grill. “One for fuel, one for friendship.”

Naomi Kuroda raised an eyebrow without stopping her hands. Tongs flashed, fat hissed, and the smell of sweet soy hit him like a memory of better days. “You again, investigator? You paying or casing my grill?”

“Both,” Haruto said. “The second is for whoever thinks I don’t see him.”

Her smile was quick and dry. “You and your dramatic lines. That’ll be three coppers—guild rates, since you flash that card.”

He slid three coppers across and, because her eyes had flicked down, showed the scuffed rectangle of lacquered wood in his other hand: F‑rank provisional investigator, Thornwall Registry. The edges were worn, the stamp was real, and it did nothing to make the hunger quieter.

Naomi passed him one skewer and let the second dangle from the tips of her tongs so it hung just at the level of his coat pocket. He took both with a nod and drifted away along the stall’s edge, away from her light and into shadow where he could watch without going blind.

*Focus rides on food; stop pretending otherwise.* He bit once—hot, sweet, perfect—and put the second skewer where a hand looking for a purse might find it.

The market wasn’t loud. Greyreach rarely was. The rune‑lamps thrummed. An echo wire pole on the corner clicked out boat arrivals—once for incoming coal, twice for river barley. Far off beneath the drizzle, the glyphrail whistled as it slid across the viaduct like a silver thought, too fast to see.

He watched the flow. It was a habit trained into him by a lazy man with sharp eyes.

*Choose the exit before you enter.* Kanzaki’s voice, as usual, dropped in uninvited. *If you don’t know the exit, you’re not here. You’re lost.*

Exit: the alley by the rope warehouse, a slit that led to the quay steps if you didn’t mind your coat catching on splinters.

He let his gaze slide past faces, belts, hands. A left‑foot drag two stalls down. A jacket a size too big with a seam cut for the quick slip. A boy who watched reflections in puddles instead of the people around them. That last one almost made Haruto smile.

He shifted so the wet flagstones pooled a neat mirror at his feet. In it he saw a thin hand test the air near his pocket. He didn’t look. He took another slow bite, and his stomach chose that moment to growl like a cornered animal.

The hand in the reflection flinched.

“Subtle,” Naomi said from behind the grill. She wasn’t looking at him either. She was slicing pickled radish for someone else, eyes on her work. “Your stomach could start a fight.”

“It ends them faster,” Haruto said, and the hand in the reflection hesitated again, then moved on, skimming past his pocket to a seamstress’s belt two steps away. The seamstress had stopped for a curtain rope sample. Her purse was an old thing, threadbare where it rubbed against her hip each day. Easy.

The hand plucked. The boy eased away.

Haruto walked two paces and turned as if idly. He didn’t sprint. Sprinting got you trampled or stabbed. He cut the angle instead, sliding between a crockery seller and a barrel of oranges, dipping his shoulder as a man swore because his hat got spattered by the drizzle. He moved like water seeking a drain.

The pickpocket—wiry, a buzz of nervous energy under a thin jacket—made for the blind corner behind Naomi’s stall. Haruto made for the corner, too.

He reached it first.

He held up his second skewer like a traffic wand. “Trade you one skewer for everything in your left sleeve.”

The boy skidded, eyes wide, shoes slapping the slick stones. He had street in his face: the set of the jaw that said he never got caught unless he wanted to. He was thirteen or fourteen at most, hair stuck in wet spikes, a little scar near his eyebrow that would look daring when it healed.

“It’s chicken,” the boy said, staring at the skewer. “I don’t trade for chicken.”

“Two bites and I forget your face.”

“You already know my face.”

“I’m very forgetful when fed.”

The boy stared at him, then at the alley mouth, measuring distance and angles. It was a good brain at work, quick and careful. Then the smell reached him full. He swallowed.

Haruto waggled the skewer once. “Left sleeve.”

The boy sighed as if he were the adult disappointed in a world without honor. He reached into his left sleeve and produced a small purse and three loose coins that clinked when they fell into Haruto’s waiting palm. He eyed the skewer again. “That’s three bites.”

“Two,” Haruto said. “And you tell me who you sell to.”

“Two bites and one name is robbery.”

“Call it tax. City changed its laws at dinner.”

The boy snorted in spite of himself. “It changed on your say?”

“Only tonight.” Haruto unknotted the purse just enough to see the color of the thread inside. The seamstress had sewn her initials into the lining. He retied the string properly, the kind of proper knot that wouldn’t slip again, and kept his hands visible so the kid could see he wasn’t pocketing anything that wasn’t his.

“Who buys lifted goods?”

“Depends,” the boy said. “Rings go to the fence by the ink shop. Purses go to—”

He stopped.

Haruto didn’t press yet. He offered the skewer.

The boy took a bite. His eyes rolled up like a priest seeing a miracle. Heat hit him a second later and he yelped, fanning his mouth. “It assaulted me,” he said, betrayed. “The skewer assaulted me.”

“That’s one bite,” Haruto said. “What nights do the lions prowl?”

The boy hesitated, then gave up a sliver because his hunger had betrayed him. “Quay Nine tonight. They call it ‘collection.’ It’s not a secret.” He took another bite in a way that was almost a glare. “Two bites means you forget my face.”

“What’s your name so I can forget it properly?”

He rolled his eyes. “Kenta. Kenta Mori. Which you’ll forget.”

“Kenta‑whoever,” Haruto said cheerfully. “Do you want a third bite or to keep your secrets for a fence who will pay you with spoiled coins?”

Kenta’s jaw tightened. He swallowed what he’d stolen from the skewer and looked past Haruto toward the market, toward the way guards pretended the alleys didn’t exist.

“You sell to who?” Haruto asked, softer.

“The man with the grey cap near Rope Lane,” Kenta said at last. “He pays clean when he’s not drunk, and he’s less grabby than the Dock Lions. But if they see you sell, they tax your fingers.”

“Cheerful.” Haruto passed him the stick. “Deal, then. Hot food for alley news. No name drops to guards unless lives are at stake. And if violence is planned, you warn me. I show up and pick battles I can finish.”

Kenta scowled at the stick because it was suddenly empty. He’d inhaled the last of it while Haruto talked. “What if I warn you and you still get knifed?”

“Then you inherit my remaining skewer debts,” Haruto said. “Big burden. Think before you wish it.”

Kenta’s mouth twitched. He tried to kill the smile and half succeeded. “You’re weird for an investigator.”

“I’m broke for an investigator,” Haruto said. “Which looks the same. Go. And maybe stop lifting from seamstresses. They can sew curses into hems.”

Kenta snorted and slid past him into the flow. He didn’t bolt. He ghosted, which meant he might not be lost to the alleys. Hungry. Smart. *Kid watches exits first. Not cruel. Hungry. Easy to push, easier to hire.*

Haruto tucked the purse into his coat and stepped back into the light.

Naomi was waiting with a look that was both exasperated and fond. “Tell me you didn’t bribe a pickpocket with dinner in my own alley,” she said.

“Impossible,” Haruto said. “I bribed him with dinner I bought legally from your excellent stall.”

“You bought two and you return one half‑eaten?” Her eyes slid to the purse in his hand.

“It was an exchange of ideas.”

She shook her head and pointed with her tongs toward the seamstress, who was wringing her hands as she searched her belt three stalls down. “Go be the hero before you mangle the language further.”

He went. The seamstress saw the purse and went soft with relief. Her eyes watered, then closed as she held the old leather to her chest. “Oh, thank you. Thank you. I thought—”

Haruto nodded. “All here,” he said, and let her check in sight of everyone. “Maybe try a belt sheath inside the coat next time. Not ideal in summer, but—”

“I will. I will, thank you.” She pressed a coin into his hand. It wasn’t much, but there was gratitude with it, and gratitude bought a kind of luck. “You’re one of those guild boys?”

“Trying to be,” Haruto said, not correcting her. He held up the scuffed card again for a heartbeat and let it vanish. “F‑rank means errands and small miracles.”

She laughed a little through her relief, bowed, and was gone.

The echo wire clicked—two clicks, a pause, then four in a quick rattle—and a boatman down the way shouted something about barrels. Haruto turned back to Naomi’s stall to return her skewer stick and maybe buy dumplings he couldn’t afford. He didn’t make it.

A man stepped into the light between stalls, dropping rain from a slick black cloak. He was the sort you met at the docks after dark if you were unlucky: meat‑thick neck, a chin that had met too many fists and not enough consequences. He wore a rough iron badge shaped like a crouching lion. The pour line on the mane was cleanly visible even under the drizzle—a cheap mold, mass‑cast, finish careless.

“Evening,” the man said, voice soft in a way men used when they wanted to remind you they didn’t need to raise it to be a problem. “Tax is up. New schedule.”

Naomi didn’t flinch. Her hands slowed, then kept moving. She set a paper boat under the grill’s edge to catch drips. “We’ll talk after closing,” she said into the sizzle, and only someone standing as close as Haruto would have seen her shoulders set.

“Funny,” Haruto said, because leaving her to say it alone would be worse. “I didn’t hear the city change its laws at dinner.”

The man’s eyes cut to him. He smiled, and the smile made his scar pucker like bad stitchwork. “It changed on my say.”

“Ah,” Haruto said. “So, civic reform. What’ll you tax next, air?”

“Safety,” the man said, still soft. “We collect what folks owe for a safe night. Otherwise, who knows. Fires happen.”

Naomi’s hand paused a fraction. Haruto noticed. *Mark, don’t bark.* Kanzaki again, and this time Haruto agreed with him.

He lifted his hands a little, palms open. “We’ll talk after closing,” he echoed, borrowing Naomi’s line because it set the time and the place on their terms. “Crowds make me hungry and stupid.”

The man’s eyes lingered on the skewer stick in Haruto’s hand. “Looks like you already ate stupid.”

Haruto smiled back. “Comes naturally.”

They looked at each other for a beat. Haruto noticed small things and filed them away as if his head were a shelf waiting for labeled jars: iron badge, rough pour, mane line, two rings missing from his right hand but tan lines still visible—pawned or punished. Scars on his knuckles, old and blunt. Not a knifeman. A clubber. The faint smell of cheap lamp oil on his cloak.

*Not tonight. Pick battles you can finish. The rest? You mark and you wait.*

“After closing,” Naomi said again, gentler, because she had customers listening now and fear was bad for business. “You know the hour.”

The man tipped an invisible hat. “Quay Nine,” he said, letting it float in the air like a dare, and drifted back into the crowd, cloak brushing wet against people who didn’t quite dare complain.

Naomi let out the breath she’d been holding. Haruto didn’t reach for her shoulder. He counted the space between his own breaths and kept his voice light. “I’ll be around Quay Nine,” he said, as if they were scheduling tea. “Call it curiosity.”

“Call it stupid,” she said. Her mouth had sharpened; her eyes had not. She set a paper boat on the counter with six dumplings rolled in sesame and brushed with chilli oil. “On credit.”

“Naomi,” he began.

“Don’t argue with your quartermaster,” she said, and because he had never met a quartermaster he liked as much as he liked her, he didn’t argue. He took the boat.

“Consider this an investment,” she added. “If you get yourself killed, I’ll hunt your ghost for my coppers.”

“I’ll put it in the will,” he said. He angled the dumplings toward his mouth and one toward the pocket where he’d seen Kenta ghosting just outside the lamplight. The boy was already gone. Good. Smart.

Haruto ate two dumplings like a man obeying medical orders and tucked the rest in his coat. The echo wire clicked again. The glyphrail sang to itself far off like a kettle ready to scream.

“Haruto,” Naomi said, quieter now that the rush had shifted elsewhere, “if you’re going to watch Quay Nine, don’t go alone.”

“I never go alone,” he said, and tapped his head. “I bring a committee.”

She made a face that said his jokes needed seasoning. He lifted the paper boat in a small salute and slipped away into the drizzle, keeping to shadows because shadows were honest about what they were.

---

His room was two flights up from a nail shop and one across from a joiner who snored with the regularity of an old metronome. It had a window that looked obliquely at the canal if he leaned out far enough to make the landlady scream from below. Tonight, the water reflected a single crooked rune‑lamp, broken by rings where the rain found it.

He set his coat over the back of the lone chair and his paper boat on the table. Coins came next. He counted them into neat piles by color and weight, set aside rent in the cracked teacup he used as a bank, and left the small reward coin from the seamstress gleaming on the table as if looking at it might turn it into three.

A thin folder lay on the table already, the one he pulled out most nights, even if only to touch the cover. OLD ARSON — DOCKS, written where a better investigator might have left it to grow dust. A sketch of a feather clipped in the corner with a bent pin. No speech about it. No wall of names. Just the outline of something that had burned people out of homes and left their cries in the wood.

Haruto opened the folder long enough to look at the feather again and at a note in his own handwriting that said, simply, No pattern yet. He closed it and reached for a dumpling.

*One purse saved buys maybe two meals. Ten purses don’t fix the docks.* He chewed, stared at the window’s watery light, and let the thought sit. *Prove you’re worth hiring, Haruto. Or at least worth not ignoring.*

The table was pocked with old ink burns where someone else had spilled behind on candle work. He had a better habit. He took out his small notebook, the one whose first pages were crowded with unhelpful philosophies and whose middle pages were all bullet points that made his head feel clearer. He wrote three clean lines:

— Quay Nine — collectors.
— Kenta — hungry but smart.
— Badge — iron pour line on mane.

He paused, then added a fourth, because he liked reminding himself he had rules.
— Exit before enter: rope warehouse alley.

The joiner across the way paused in his snoring as if on cue, coughed twice, then resumed with admirable commitment. Haruto smiled despite himself and finished a third dumpling.

He reached for the old folder again, then stopped. *Not tonight.* The feather would wait. It had waited through worse.

He sat back, ribs easing against the chair, and let the hunger settle. He closed his eyes.

*Pick battles you can finish. The rest? You mark and you wait.*

He opened his eyes again to the room’s small honesty. A coat, a table, a chair, a bed that had been a sofa in a previous life and now complained when he lay on it. A city beyond the window that worked until it didn’t.

He had a plan for tonight that was simple enough even for a hungry man. He would go to Quay Nine. He would watch the “collection.” He would follow, quietly, and if the path led somewhere he could do something that mattered, he would do it. If not, he would gather detail until detail turned into a lever.

*Tomorrow—watch the collection, follow, eat first.*

He folded the old folder closed and slid it under the table as if that would make it less of a weight in the room. He picked up his coat, shook a few raindrops off it for old time’s sake, and was sliding his arms into the sleeves when the bell began to hammer.

It wasn’t the echo wire. It wasn’t a street crier’s panicked voice. It was the big bell on a post by the canal that only rang fast when there was fire, the kind of fire that ran its fingers where it pleased and didn’t respect property lines.

Haruto froze for half a second and then moved. Coat. Boots. Notebook in the inside pocket. The paper boat of dumplings crammed between his teeth for a second so he could tie his laces, then back into his coat. He didn’t bother with the umbrella because umbrellas and fires were an argument he couldn’t win.

He got to the stairs as someone below shouted from the street, “Fire at Quay Nine!”

“Of course it is,” Haruto said to no one and everyone, and took the steps two at a time. The landlady said something about rent and he said something about life and they both forgave each other in the way of people who liked living in the same building.

Outside, the drizzle had thickened into a mean mist that lit yellow where the rune‑lamps breathed. He ran the way he always ran at first—light, testing the road, making sure he didn’t slide where the flagstones were slickest. Then he opened up, counting his breaths, counting his steps, counting the places he could hide a body if he needed to hide his own.

The canal took him west toward the quays. The echo wire stuttered and then died, because when there’s fire the wires shut up and the bells talk. A boy darted across his path, hair wild and eyes wider, and for a moment Haruto thought it was Kenta, but it wasn’t. The smell reached him next—lamp oil, old tar, singed rope, the peculiar sweet of burning grain if a warehouse lost its mind.

He slowed a fraction when the street choked. People moved away from the quays in a flow he used as cover, sliding against it at an angle so he lost no speed but gained information. Voices threw pieces of a picture: “—Quay Nine—” “—ran right past—” “—lions, I swear I saw—”

He reached the end of the rope warehouse alley and ducked into it, back against the wet brick long enough to listen. The bell beat a fast heart. The light was orange, too orange, reflected in channels of rain that ran toward the canal like small rivers fleeing a larger one.

He looked at the alley’s other end. He didn’t know yet what he would do when he reached the quay. He knew only that “watch” had just become “run.”

He grinned, involuntary and quick, the way he always did when trouble stopped hinting and started speaking clearly. “Bad timing,” he said aloud to the bell, to Naomi’s dumplings, to the old feather sketch under his table. “Good bait.”

He pushed off the wall and ran toward the light with the half‑eaten skewer clamped in his teeth like a ridiculous sword.

Dinner later. Fire first.
