# Chapter 4 — Steam & Dumplings

Morning didn’t so much arrive as show up, shrug, and lean against Haruto’s window.

He set the egg on a folded shirt on his rickety table. Soot had set into the garment like freckles. The joiner across the alley changed snore keys. The echo wire outside clicked slow boat codes, polite and sleepy.

“Kitchen science, rookie edition,” Haruto told the room. “Peer‑reviewed by my stomach.”

He set his kettle to hum. Steam lifted in a small silver line. The egg—smooth, forearm‑long, heavier than it looked—warmed his palms and answered with a low *vrmmm*.

He put it down carefully. He angled the kettle until steam flowed over the shell.

“Trial one,” he said, because talking to objects was less alarming if you made it sound official. “Heat only.”

The hum grew a notch; not louder so much as steadier, like a string finding tune. Haruto counted to ninety with the same easy cadence he used for step counts. *Numbers before verbs.*

He slid the kettle back and cracked open Naomi’s packet. Dumplings perfumed the air: ginger, chive, a whisper of sesame. His Evermind committee raised their hands all at once. *Control sample? Temptation control?*

“Trial two,” he said, opening the paper a finger width. He let steam drift across the dumplings and then across the shell at the same time.

The hum jumped—two notches this time, a happy cat on a windowsill. The committee noted the correlation with smug neatness.

“Trial three.” He held one dumpling above the shell like a priest of snacks blessing a parishioner. He did not touch the egg with oily dough. He kept his hand steady and the dumpling at a consistent distance, because if you were going to do fake science you could at least do tidy fake science.

The egg purred.

Haruto stared. Then he very solemnly ate the control sample.

“Conclusion,” he said through a mouthful. “Aroma and warmth. We can be consistent about that. House rules.”

He scribbled lines in his notebook.

— Steam 90 sec → hum ↑.

— Steam + aroma → hum ↑↑.

— Dumpling over shell → hum ↑↑ (no contact).

— Care rule: warmth/steam on cycle. No jostle. Avoid cold/ shock.

He added, smaller:

— Deferred truth: log private; file later with proof.

He looked at the egg. The surface had the tiniest traceries, not cracks, more like fine threads under glaze. The hum sat comfy now, the way the kettle eased when it reached its favorite pitch.

“If food calms me,” he told it, “we can be consistent about that. House rules.”

The egg did not disagree.

He wrapped it in a soft shirt, left the top open so steam could find it, and warmed a clean cloth over the kettle. He wrapped that around the outside and then tucked the bundle back under his coat. Heat spread across his ribs.

Haruto stood and practiced three answers aloud, quiet and simple.

“If someone stops me and asks what I’m carrying: ‘Lunch.’”

“If the watch asks: ‘Evidence notes and lunch.’”

“If Naomi asks: ‘Dumplings.’”

*I log it now. I file it when safe,* he told himself. *Not a lie—deferred.*

He mapped his route before he touched the latch. Exit before enter. He drew it in his head: stairwell noise cover → market edge → Rope Lane → bell post → home. Cart gap by Naomi if needed. Rope ladder on the barge as last resort.

He breathed once, shallow.

The committee voted. He stepped out.

---

Rope Lane still wore the night on its bricks. The tar door wore his chili smear like makeup that refused to wash off.

He traced exits with his eyes, marked them with habit: canal stairs, cart gap by Naomi’s stall, rope ladder on the barge rail. People flowed around him like a creek with opinions.

Haruto crouched at the door and set his notebook on his knee. He rubbed a clean graphite over the key corner of the counter‑ward, caught the forty‑five‑degree cut, labeled the angle, and added tiny arrows at the shear shine on the screw holes.

He stepped back, measured the plaque void with his palm. “Nine by twelve,” he murmured. “My hand, not yours.”

His Evermind highlighted the ground—two scuffs near the void. Two different tread patterns; one heel dragged a little with each footfall. *Injury? Heavy carry?* He sketched both and drew a thin line toward the canal.

He didn’t look up when a shadow filled the lane mouth. He didn’t need to. The cheap iron lion badge told him the rest. Pour seam on the mane. Not filed clean. Image over craft.

“You again,” the Dock Lion said. He leaned so his badge caught the shard of sun sneaking into the lane. “Counting bricks for the city?”

“Counting angles,” Haruto said without pausing. “More reliable than moods.”

“You got a name?”

“Haruto,” he said. “Dumpling‑adjacent.”

The Lion snorted. “You think you’re clever.”

“I think I like clean lines,” Haruto said, still making them. He breathed through his mouth. The egg hummed against his ribs like a polite cough.

The man was taller by enough to make it a habit. The habit wanted to push. Haruto let the habit make noise and moved his pencil anyway.

“Door’s your hobby?” the Lion asked.

“Ward sabotage is boring and illegal,” Haruto said mildly. “Boring things get filed. Illegal things get filed faster.”

The Lion’s jaw moved like a man chewing a difficult nut. He tilted his head. “We’ll see you around the quay.”

“Don’t trip,” Haruto said, and he meant it. The scuff lines said the quay was winning.

The Lion left his spine in the lane like a warning and took his feet with him. Haruto didn’t turn to watch him go. *Mark, don’t bark.* He did not escalate. He kept pencil to paper, labeled the treads, stood, and slid his notebook into his coat.

Pressure present. Not a bite yet.

He moved on.

---

Naomi’s stall already smelled like decisions. Steam wreaths curled out of stacked baskets. The pan gave a flat metallic *GONG* when her ladle hit it—her signature, her weather report, her patience gauge.

She saw him and didn’t hide the relief. “Eat first,” she said, thrusting a skewer at him like a command stamp. “If you faint, I’m charging for theatre.”

“I refuse to give you the satisfaction,” he said, already biting. Salt hit, then sweet glaze, then char, and his brain stopped trying to vote on five other actions and agreed to be here.

His elbow nudged his coat. The egg hummed once, tiny. The pan‑bang covered it.

Two Dock Lions swaggered by with their own weather patterns. One man tapped Naomi’s tip jar like a bell. Coins chimed. He smiled like a shelf unstable on purpose.

“Fire season,” Lion #1 said, faux‑friendly. “Stall fee’s up.”

Naomi’s eyebrows went up into a place fog could not reach. “I changed nothing in my stall,” she said. “You changed your mouth.”

Haruto stepped half a pace, slow and obvious, so they had to detour around him to keep moving forward. He didn’t square his shoulders. He angled them as if apologizing to the air.

“You’re blocking the bucket line marker,” he said helpfully, pointing to chalk on the cobbles. “If a bell rings, folks trip. It’s a liability.”

Lion #2 looked down reflexively. Haruto didn’t smile. He didn’t give them the satisfaction of either fear or invitation.

“Is the season registered with the watch,” Haruto asked, in the tone of a man checking schedules, “or just your mold?”

The man’s gaze flicked to Haruto’s coat, then to Naomi’s hands, then to the badge seam on his friend’s chest, as if noticing it for the first time. Pride didn’t like seams.

Naomi touched Haruto’s wrist under the counter, a quick ground. “Pick a battle you can finish,” she said, low.

“Copy,” Haruto said. Then, louder, to the Lions: “Walk around the mark so the city doesn’t trip on you.”

They moved on because momentum is a kind of strength and they preferred to keep it. The look they left behind said we’ll remember. Haruto put a line under that look in his head and filed it next to *do not be here alone at night.*

Naomi exhaled through her nose. “You’re going to give me grey hair,” she told him. “New grey hair. And I do not suit it.”

“You’d weaponize it,” Haruto said. “Thank you.”

She slid a small paper packet under his hand. “For later.”

He weighed it. “Later when?”

“When you start thinking through chairs again.” She banged the pan, delighted at her own timing.

“Food is a down payment on not being stupid,” she added, pleasant and ruthless.

“I wrote it down,” he said.

“Underlined,” she said.

“Twice,” he said.

“Good boy,” she said, and scowled at him to keep him from grinning.

He moved off, steadier.

Kenta Mori appeared out of a crate’s shadow like an alley cat with paperwork. He stood just out of arm’s reach with a grin that knew it would get fed.

“Two bites for a rumor,” he said, eyes on the packet in Haruto’s hand.

“One bite,” Haruto said, “and you get promoted to ‘don’t get arrested.’”

Kenta pretended to consider dignity and lost. He took a bite.

“Grey‑Cap’s awake,” he said around it. “Buys metal square things when sober. Sells ‘art’ when drunk. Rope Lane, ink shop wall. Smells like old paper and noodles.”

“Looking for wall jewelry,” Haruto said. “Missing its screws.”

Kenta snorted. “You a priest of bolts now?”

“Lay brother,” Haruto said. “Any chatter on feather coins?”

Kenta’s face did a little shrug. “Saw a weird coin at the net repair bench. Feather angle wrong. Guy put it away fast.”

“Routes?” Haruto asked. “Anyone dodging bell posts on deliveries yesterday?”

“Canal runners cut through the lamp yard,” Kenta said without needing a second bite. “Left when the bell rang, right before the watch horn. One dropped a book. Smelled like cumin. I took it to stop it getting wet and now two big boys are looking for it.”

Haruto paused, then lifted his packet and gave Kenta the second bite he hadn’t earned yet.

“Bring it tonight,” he said. “Dusk knock: tap‑tap…tap. If it’s a book, we’ll read it. If it’s soup, we’ll eat it.”

Kenta grinned so hard he might have been paid in sunshine. “Deal.”

“Skewer Scouts, then,” Haruto said softly.

Kenta straightened like he’d been drafted into a very respectable army. “Skewer Scouts,” he said, solemn.

They split. Haruto tucked the packet away and let the egg hum against his ribs like a very small drum.

---

The bell post watchman with the chipped tooth had slept just enough to make honesty look possible. He raised one eyebrow at the sight of Haruto and didn’t bother to hide a second, smaller eyebrow that said *kid again?*

“I brought boring,” Haruto said. He laid the duplicate rubbing on the post, added his clean measurements, and pointed with a pencil at each tidy line as if presenting a cake.

“Forty‑five cut,” he said. “Same hand as last night. Plaque void nine by twelve hand‑spans. Screws sheared—flat shine, not twist out. Wick flake here.” He tapped a folded paper packet. “And—new—two tread patterns by the void. One heel dragging. Direction: canal.”

The watchman’s mouth did a pleased thing he then disguised as a cough. He slid the rubbing into a leather folder. “That we can file,” he said, the closest thing to a blessing the bell had heard all day.

“Photo of the plaque?” he asked without looking up.

“Working the scrap angle,” Haruto said. “Might find it before the thief finds a file.”

The watchman let that sit. “Lions are sniffing for whoever thinks in lanes,” he said, quiet. “Keep your head where the vendor can hit it with a spoon.”

“Already contracted for spoon deterrence,” Haruto said.

The watchman’s chipped tooth clicked against his tongue when he smirked. He gestured with his chin at the market. “I like you when you talk paper before names,” he said.

“Names get loud,” Haruto said. “Paper gets patient.”

The watchman grunted, which in watchman language meant *yes* and also *get out of here before my boss looks at you.*

Haruto obeyed.

---

Grey‑Cap had placed himself at the corner near the ink shop like a gargoyle on break. His cap was the color of surrendered rain. A shelf of bent spoons leaned against a crate with ambition. A burlap square covered a stack of… art.

“Looking for wall jewelry,” Haruto said. “Missing its screws.”

Grey‑Cap squinted as if eyeing a mirage. “You a priest of bolts?”

“Lay brother,” Haruto said, kneeling to peer without touching.

Under the burlap: a metal rectangle too small for his plaque void. But near it, a plate with *sheared screws* still clinging like bitter teeth. He didn’t reach. He didn’t need to.

“How much for the spoon with the personality disorder?” Haruto asked, picking up the bent one. He kept his expression the same temperature as the weather.

“Three,” Grey‑Cap said.

“I have one,” Haruto said, which was mostly true.

“Two,” Grey‑Cap said, offended by compromise.

“Done,” Haruto said.

He paid a coin, took the spoon, and when Grey‑Cap bent to move the next bit of art, Haruto slid his graphite across a scrap of paper and pressed it lightly to the sheared screw spacing on the smaller plate. Spaced just so. He pulled back before greed could make it look like intent.

“You buy art?” Grey‑Cap asked, puzzled.

“I buy measurements,” Haruto said. “They’re cheaper.”

Grey‑Cap snorted and flipped the burlap back over the stack like a magician hiding shame. “City takes things off walls. I sell walls back to the city. It’s a circle.”

“That’s a religion,” Haruto said, and made a note in his head: *Multiple plaques being stripped. Pattern bigger than one lane.*

He didn’t try to buy the wrong plate. He didn’t flash hunger. He left with a bent spoon and a rubbing of spacing that would let him match screw holes to a thief’s collection later.

Mark, don’t bark. Don’t be memorable.

---

Home felt smaller when you had a secret with mass.

Haruto shut the door with his heel and set the egg back on the folded shirt, then moved the kettle to a low mutter. He opened Naomi’s second paper packet—dumplings—and the room filled with a smell that could talk a man out of arguments.

The egg’s hum smoothed out like a breath finding rhythm.

“All right,” he said softly. “We write this down.”

He drafted a simple care protocol he would not be ashamed to show anyone later.

— Steam cycle: 60–90 sec every 2–3 hours (home).

— Aroma cue: food nearby calms (esp. dumplings).

— Keep wrap warm; no direct heat; no cold shock.

— Don’t jostle. No stairs at speed.

— Deferred truth timer: report once stabilized + owner/ritual link identified.

— If taken outside: carry warm cloth. Avoid watch dogs; avoid Lions.

He looked at the last two lines. *I am not ready to write ‘dragon.’ I am ready to write ‘responsibility.’* He underlined *deferred truth* once, the exact number of times a promise stays a promise.

“You hum, I feed,” he said to the egg. “We keep each other from doing anything stupid.”

Outside, two dockworkers argued about fire marks. “Copycat,” one said. “Mark’s wrong on purpose.” Haruto filed it in the drawer labeled *later* and turned the kettle spout a fraction. The egg answered with a soft *vrmmm* that vibrated up his wrist.

He ate two dumplings with reverent efficiency and then one fast because he was not a saint. He washed down the third with a cup of kettle water because tea was expensive and patience more so.

A knock came. Light, kid heartbeat: **tap‑tap…tap.**

Haruto opened the door.

Kenta slid inside like a rumor committed to good posture. He held a grease‑spotted notebook up with both hands like an offering to a minor god.

“Recipes,” Kenta whispered. “If it’s soup, it’s hot. If it’s not… it’s still hot.”

Haruto took the notebook. It was ordinary in the way important things like to be. Oil had kissed the corners. Grease had set a thumbprint. He flipped it open to a page full of tidy lists.

CLOVE, CUMIN, BAY.

The next page: PEPPER (BLACK), STAR ANISE, GINGER—then, in the margins, lines without meaning until you thought like a courier: *three spices each time; sometimes four; sometimes one capitalized; sometimes a line left blank.*

The committee started to murmur. *Not ingredients—time codes.* Spice initials as bells. Capitals for dock posts. Blanks for delay. Clove‑Cumin‑Bay might be C‑C‑B, or three o’clock‑two o’clock‑one? Or three canals? Or—

Kenta watched his face like a street watching a storm.

Haruto kept his own voice calm. “Two big boys?”

“Looking for this book,” Kenta said. “Asked the lamp yard man if he saw a ‘cookbook.’ He said yes to be helpful and now he’s hiding in his shed.”

“Don’t get heroic,” Haruto said. “Get fed and on time.”

Kenta’s grin tried to break out of his face and make new friends. “Promotion benefits are confusing.”

“Breakfast,” Haruto said. He put a dumpling in Kenta’s hand and the boy made the noise humans make when they are reminded that the world contains good ideas.

“We’ll cook it in the morning,” Haruto said, flipping back to the index. In tiny letters at the bottom of a page someone had scrawled: *bay=bell, cumin=canal, clove=court…* It wasn’t complete. It was enough to start.

Kenta nodded so seriously his hair bowed. “I’ll knock the same way.”

“Tap‑tap…tap,” Haruto said.

“Friendly code,” Kenta said.

Haruto set the cookbook on the table, on the other side from the egg. Steam curled up and made the page edges wave like small flags.

The egg hummed, content. The kettle whispered. The echo wire clicked barley boat news. The city leaned its weight on his wall and pretended not to listen.

Haruto wrote the next small truth.

— Ledger uses kitchen words as route/time code. Decode in morning.

He set the kettle to whisper and opened Naomi’s packet a little wider. The egg’s hum smoothed out again, easy as breath.

“All right,” he said to the room. “We work the small truths first.”

Kenta tapped the clove‑cumin‑bay page with a noodle‑oily finger. “Hungry?” he asked.

Haruto smiled. “Starving,” he said. “Let’s eat a schedule.”
