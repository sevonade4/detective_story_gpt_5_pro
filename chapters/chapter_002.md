# Chapter 2 — Bell, Fire, and the Quiet Spark

Quay Nine flickered like a bad memory.

Smoke rolled off the waterfront, orange light stuttering in the rain as if someone had painted fire on the mist. The big bell hammered from the canal post until it felt like the sound lived in Haruto’s bones. The echo wire along the road had gone dead the way it always did during a major blaze—bells talk, wires shut up.

People flowed away from the quays in a messy river. Haruto slid along its edge at an angle, gaining ground without pushing. The rune‑lamps hummed louder when wet, a low note under the shouting, and the smell coming off the water was wrong for an accident—lamp oil and tar over rope and damp wood.

*Exit before enter.* He slowed in the shadow of a rope warehouse and counted. *Rope alley to the steps. Boat stairs two lengths left. Low pier gap under the third piling if I’m willing to get wet.*

He eased into the alley and peeked past the corner. A warehouse door on the quay side stood half open, fire licking along the floorboards inside like a cat discovering a new room. Kindling had been stacked in tidy ribs leading up to crates that shouldn’t have been that dry in this weather.

A vendor staggered past with a wet cloth over her mouth. “Fire shouldn’t climb like that,” she coughed at nobody and everybody.

“Fires don’t climb,” Haruto said, just loud enough, eyes on the neat stacks. “People stack ladders.”

He crouched by a crate that had come up just shy of the flames. The bottom edge was propped on a chipped wedge and something darker ran out under it in a faint line, slick and purposeful. He put a knuckle down and brought it up shining. Oil. He followed the line with his eyes until it vanished into the smoke.

*Jar. Wedge. Not accident.*

Across the quay, three men moved against the panic. They wore the wrong calm for a crisis and low, rough iron lions on their cloaks. Even through the drizzle Haruto could see the pour seam along the mane—the badge mold cheap and careless. The biggest of the three did a quick headcount down the line of stalls the way a butcher counts ribs, and another ducked into the narrow service lane behind the warehouses with a satchel clutched close.

Haruto’s hunger made an unhelpful noise.

“Later,” he told his stomach, and chose his target.

---

The runner with the satchel cut across a gangplank that had seen better seasons. Haruto mirrored his angle, using a bucket line as cover. People stood in two lines from canal to quay, passing sloshing pails hand to hand with the kind of efficiency that sprouts in cities that can’t wait for guards. He timed his step to the rhythm of the pass so the runner’s quick look back saw only ordinary motion.

Someone fleeing shoved him from the side. Tar rope slid under his boot, slick as eels. Haruto’s foot flew, and his temple found the iron mooring ring with a sound that felt like someone tapping a spoon in his head.

The bell went under water. The world went thin.

*Stay awake,* he told himself. *Count exits. Three. No—six. How do I see six?*

A taste came up from a deep shelf in his skull: citrus peel and warm spice. The memory of a tiny bottle from a bad year. He had been small then, feverish and stubborn. Kanzaki had laughed with eyes that weren’t laughing and called it a tonic with a poetic label. Quiet Spark.

Something in his mind… clicked.

Sound widened back out, but cleaner. The bell’s hammer beat separated from the splash of buckets, the splash separated from rain. Firelight sorted into layers. Shapes moved and the wake they left told him where they would be a breath later.

He exhaled and the breath came out even.

*Okay,* he thought, slightly stunned at himself. *So that’s new.*

He pushed off the ring and stayed low. The runner cut between a stack of tarps and a coil of line, head turning to check his tail at a regular three‑count. In the new, steady space in Haruto’s head, three action threads unspooled, then six, then nine. He picked one that didn’t cost his ribs and didn’t scare civilians.

A barrel at the alley mouth had rolled off its chock in the panic and pinned a child against a post. A man was trying to lift it with his back rounded and his breath wrong. Haruto didn’t stop moving. He kicked the chock into place with the toe of his boot and the barrel rolled just enough to free the kid’s legs.

“You—hands low, lift on three,” Haruto said, pointing at the older man and a woman with a bucket. He didn’t shout. He put the numbers in the sentence before the verbs so the movement went in first. “One—two—three.”

They lifted. The kid slid out. The runner glanced back right then. Haruto turned his face away and carried the motion into a step that made him part of the alley wall.

“Who put you in charge?” the man grunted, breath coming right this time.

“Dinner did,” Haruto said, which would have been funnier if his stomach hadn’t chosen that exact moment to threaten mutiny.

Vision sparkled at the edges like heat above a road. He dug in his coat, came up with Naomi’s sesame dumplings, and crammed two into his mouth fast enough to bite his own thumb. Chilli oil smeared the corner of his lip and smeared his glove when he wiped it. The second he swallowed, a calm ribboned through the sparkles. The ribbon wasn’t permanent. It was enough.

*Brain’s a storm. Legs are a donkey. Pace or crash.*

The runner’s satchel bumped his hip as he took the next corner. It jingled in a way loot didn’t. Haruto knew the language of coin purses and this wasn’t it. This was glass kissing glass under leather, with a deeper clink of metal thrown in. He got a glance when the flap lifted for a heartbeat—jar necks, blackened corks, a twist of wick. Fuse jars. Collection plus arson kit in one carrier. Efficient.

A scratched ward glowed faintly on the warehouse side door he passed—a standard fire counter‑glyph that should have stood between the first flame and the rest of the block. Someone had cut the key stroke in the corner with a knife.

*Trained hands,* Haruto thought. *Lions don’t write wards. Someone showed them the stroke to cut.*

The runner took the service lane behind the rope houses. Wet stone, close walls, the sound of two more men entering the far end of the lane broadsided Haruto’s new calm for a beat.

Outnumbered. Still hungry. No weapon that wouldn’t turn panic into blood in a heartbeat.

*Mark, don’t bark,* Kanzaki’s voice said in the most irritatingly reasonable way.

Haruto looked down at his glove. Chilli oil shone red and spicy in the lamplight. He looked at the swinging line that hung from a pulley above. Then at the tar‑stained door halfway down the lane. Then at the satchel.

He didn’t plan to be a genius. It just happened.

He stepped forward quick as a shrug and faked a stumble into the hanging line. It swung like a lazy pendulum and kissed the runner’s shoulder just enough to nudge him sideways. The satchel bumped the tar door hard enough that leather met wood.

A neat red smear bloomed, unabashed and bright.

Haruto smiled at the color like it was an old friend. Chili tracking dye. Patented this minute.

“Run along, guild boy,” one of the men at the far end said, lifting his chin like an insult.

Haruto had his most pleasant voice ready. “Already did,” he said. “Twice.”

He nudged a wedge with his heel as he backed up. The wedge had been keeping a stack of wet nets from slumping. They slumped. Slow, half‑heavy, perfectly inconvenient. The two men swore in chorus as the nets came down across their legs, not dangerous but very enthusiastically damp. It bought him three seconds and a clean line to the street. He took both.

He let the satchel runner go. He’d marked more valuable things—route, door, rhythm. The doorframe had a clean square where a plaque had been recently removed. Not scrubbed, not painted over—lifted. Someone had decided the symbol it had shown needed to disappear before a fire night.

*Not a random door. Not a random lane.*

He took one more look at the scratched ward, at the clean square, at the red smear drying like a dare, and slid back toward the quay, keeping low as a plume of heat belched out from the warehouse across the lane and licked the air where his head had been.

By the time he reached the water again, the bucket line had gotten taller and angrier. People shifted into a rhythm only labor learns, hands passing pails, feet setting their own metronomes. A city watch horn went up at last from the far side. Late, but here. A lot of people in Greyreach preferred themselves to the watch, and most nights the watch agreed with that choice.

A watchman with soot on his cheeks and a fresh chip in his tooth met his eye near the bell post. “What’ve you got?” he asked without ceremony, because Haruto’s coat and the way he looked at burning buildings said “useful” more than “tourist.”

“Jar fuse under a crate,” Haruto said, keeping his voice even and his words simple. “Wedge to prop the leak. Standard door ward cut at the corner. Kindling stacked like a ladder. This wasn’t a stove accident.”

The watchman’s jaw shifted as if he were trying not to grind his teeth into powder. “You got names?”

“Not tonight,” Haruto said. “I have a door marked in the lanes. I’ll check it in daylight and bring you a picture you can use instead of a name that runs.” *Mark, don’t bark.* He could almost hear Kanzaki’s coin flick.

The watchman stared at him a beat longer and then nodded once. “Fine. Keep out of the way of the tips. We’ve got a chance of keeping it to one block.”

“Got it,” Haruto said. He meant it. He stepped back and turned his head to keep the smoke out of his eyes.

“Haruto!”

Naomi arrived from the far side with her apron knotted like armor and her hair wrapped in a scarf that had once been white. She took one look at him and scowled at the blood in his hairline. “You let a ring hit your head?” she said, as if the ring had some nerve.

“It hit me first,” he said, which was not a smart line but felt true. The air above the fire was skewing his jokes.

She pressed a wet cloth to the cut with the sort of efficiency that could have field‑dressed a wound on a racing horse. “Hold this. And eat that.” She shoved a small wrapped parcel into his free hand, which turned out to be another roll of dumplings. “If you die hungry, I will chase your ghost with a spoon.”

“I’ll budget for that,” he said, and the watchman made a noise that might have been a laugh he wasn’t ready to admit to.

Naomi’s eyes softened for half a second. Then she stepped away and joined the bucket line like she’d been born to it. Haruto watched her slot into the rhythm and felt the bell stop living in his bones.

He ate two dumplings obediently and tucked the cloth tighter against his head. The bleeding slowed. The fire did, too, as the line beat it back. The warehouse’s open door finally spat a last gout of bad light and then sighed into steam.

When the bell slowed from hammering to a reminder and the echo wire began to click again, cautious and sputtery, Haruto turned toward the lane.

He didn’t go back in.

*Exit before enter.* The words tasted like mustard and advice. *Mark. Don’t bark. Pick battles you can finish.*

He finished the dumplings without grace and only then let his legs admit they were shaking.

---

His room still smelled like old ink and damp wood when he pushed the door shut with his foot. The joiner across the alley had paused his snoring during the fire and now resumed it with the conviction of a man whose metronome had merely needed winding.

Haruto sat, because standing had become a negotiation between shin muscles and gravity. He set Naomi’s cloth down to wash later and peeled his glove off. The chilli had left a faint orange halo on the leather where he’d wiped his mouth, and it made him smile like a fool.

He took out his notebook and wrote clear.

— Quay Nine — **not** accident. Fuse jars. Wedge. Ward scratched.
— Runner route → rope lane with tar door (**red smear**).
— Clean square where a plaque was removed.
— Cost: thinking drains fuel fast. Bring food or crash.
— No feather sign tonight. *Don’t force pattern.*

He set the pencil down and stared at the last line. The old folder on arsons hummed in the back of his head the way the rune‑lamps hummed when wet. He didn’t pull it out. He wasn’t ready to feed the part of him that wanted to make everything the feather.

His stomach rumbled like a beast woken from a nap. He found one last dumpling in his coat pocket that had somehow survived the sprint and the nets, a little flattened and perfect. He ate it with two fingers on his temple as if he could persuade the pulse there to be a normal, human thing and not a weird, cool click.

*What are you?* he asked his own mind, not expecting an answer and getting a sensation instead—threads of thought lined up clean where they had been a knot an hour ago. Possibilities sketched themselves and waited instead of trampling each other in a hurry to be heard.

*Committee,* he thought, and a stupid laugh hiccuped out of him. *I brought a committee for real.*

He didn’t take his boots off. He lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling’s hairline crack until the crack became a river on a map. His body wanted to be heavier than the bed. His mind wanted to sort buckets, routes, doors, faces, oil, kindling, cut wards, the exact three counts on the runner’s look‑back.

He closed his eyes. He wasn’t tired.

He opened them again and accepted that this might be the new normal. *Mind doesn’t sleep; body still has to. If the mind won’t tire, feed the body first.* He reached for a heel of bread he’d saved from noon and ate it because orders were orders, even when you gave them to yourself.

He listened to the echo wire outside as it wound back up to its usual work, clicking boat codes for coal and barley and a tug with a busted rune line limping to the yard. Life filled the pipes and lines and bodies of the city again.

His hand found the pencil without looking.

— Return by daylight. **Check that door.**

He set the notebook on the chair so he would trip over it in the morning because he understood himself too well. He blew out a breath that barely counted as a sigh and let the wet hum of the rune‑lamp outside, the click of the wire, and the joiner’s metronome snore stack up like kindling for a different kind of fire.

Sleep happened to his body the way a door happens to a man who has been busy pretending it isn’t locked. His mind kept sorting, quietly and cleanly, threads lined on pegs instead of wrapped around his throat.

He dreamed, somewhere close to morning, of a square on a door where something should be, and of a warm hum in the shape of an egg he had never seen.

The bell did not sound again.

The city breathed. The fire would be chalked for morning inspection. And in Haruto’s head, the click sat like a coin in the slot, waiting for what came next.
